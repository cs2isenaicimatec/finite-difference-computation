RTM-MODMIG

This program can perform both parallel RTM 
Modeling or Migration, using MPI.

Dir structure:
	src:
		Source code
	include:
		Source headers
	lib:
		Required libs for linking

	build:
		current supported models.
			testmod:	simple 4 layer model
			marmousi:   sampled marmousi
			pluto: 		full plutaÃ§o
			spluto: 	sampled pluto

Each output folder contains scripts
for building and scheduling executions
with SLURM. 
Use script sbatchrun.sh to schedule
several executions with different
fixed-point nbits.
Example:

> ./sbatchrun.sh "path_to_model" nThreads nTests

, will schedule executions with 'nTests' 
different bit-lengths, using several MPI processes
and 'nThreads' OpenMP threads per process.

Modeling outputs are stored into a 'dobs/' folder
inside each build/model, while migration outputs
are stored into 'img/' folder.

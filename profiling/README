This folders is meant to store all input models
for performance testing. The file

	inputlist

must contain the names of all input model directories,
one per line.
The last line must be kept as is in order for the
execution scripts to work properly.

Ex:
The content of the inputlist file must be like:

inputlist: 
			mod_295x415
			mod_395x515
			mod_495x615
			...
			mod_NxM
			<keep_this_line>

, where each mod_* line must equal the respective folder name.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OBS: All models must assume the repository root folder as the
execution point.

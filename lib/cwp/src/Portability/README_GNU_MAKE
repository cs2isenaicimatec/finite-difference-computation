README for GNU make                                       15 Nov 2000

Some versions of 'make' will not support the structures that we
use in our Makefiles. The best alternative is to use the
version of 'make' (commonly called 'gmake', but simply called 'make'
on some PC Unix systems) 
available from the GNU Software group (ftp site:  prep.ai.mit.edu).

Sometimes people are using GNU Make and they don't know it. If
you are, and have not made the changes in Makefile.config below,
you will get the error message:

> make[2]: *** No rule to make target `$(@F)'.  Stop.

This is a dead giveaway that you are using GNU make, but are using
the target flags for ordinary Unix make.

Support for installs using GNU make
has been included. You need to make the following changes in
Makefile.config to install with 'gmake'.

Change:
# Rules for 'GNU make' installs (includes Linux installs)
# uncomment the next line if you are using  "GNU make"
#include $(CWPROOT)/src/Rules/gnumake.rules

To:
# Rules for 'GNU make' installs (includes Linux installs)
# uncomment the next line if you are using  "GNU make"
include $(CWPROOT)/src/Rules/gnumake.rules

(If you are running on a LINUX system "make" is really "GNU make"

Note: you may have to put the full path to gmake as it appears on
your system, if you have more than one  "make" available.

After making these changes, as well as  any others that are
appropriate for your system as indicated in Makefile.config, follow
the compilation instructions in README_TO_INSTALL.

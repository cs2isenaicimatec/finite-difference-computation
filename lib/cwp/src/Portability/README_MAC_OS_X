Update of Mac OS X installation instructions.  updated 28 Feb 2006
(These instructions are good for both Panther and Tiger releases.)

You will need to download and install the Xcodes developers materials.
You will need to install X-windows (part of the installation CD).

Once you have X-windows and Xcodes, you may open an X-term. It is
a good idea to put an X-term on your dock for further usage.

Open an X-term terminal window.

Then type the following:

cd                      (to get to your home directory)

echo $SHELL             (to see what your shell is)

if this echos /bin/bash, then you will need to edit or create
the file:

.bashrc

You will need to put the following lines in .bashrc


export CWPROOT /your/cwp/root/path/here

PATH=$PATH:$CWPROOT/bin

export PATH


once you have done this, then log out and log back in.   (Please note
you don't literally type "/usr/cwp/root/path/here"  you type whatever
the directory path the directory   "src" is in when you unbundle the
tarfiles of CWP/SU.)

If you type:

echo $CWPROOT

it should type:
/your/cwp/root/path/here

echo $PATH
should show your modified path with  /your/cwp/root/path/bin 
on it.

Now follow the general instructions for installing SU on any
Unix system.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps for installing Seismic Unix under Mac OS X

 
Step 1
Install the new Operating System from Apple, Mac OS X on your Macintosh.
Mac OS X has in its core a version of the BSD UNIX operating system called
Darwin.

 
Step 2
Install the Developers disk that came with the Mac OS X disk, which contains
the tools for developing applications for the OS.

Step 3
Activate the root account on your system. You will need it to install Xwindows.
On the Mac OS X environment go to the folder "Utilities" (under "Applications")
and open the "NetInfo Manager" application. On the "Domain" menu, choose
"Security" and then choose "Enable Root User".

 
Step 4(OPTIONAL)
Install a Fortran compiler, for example g77. You can get g77 and all the steps
for install it on the site
http://www-jlc.kek.jp/~fujiik/macosx/10.0.X/memo/G77onX. html or if you prefer
go to the GNU Project site http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/ gcc.html.

 
Step 5
Download and install XFree86 for Darwin (Mac OS X). You can get the software
from the site ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.1.0/binaries/Darwin-ppc/. The
site http://www-jlc.kek.jp/~fujiik/macosx/10.0.X /memo/X11onX.html can be used
for this purpose also, with the advantage of helping you configure your system
to install and use the software.
I've also installed the Rootless XFree86 that provides rootless support for
XFree86 inside Mac OS X. You can get Rootless XFree86 from the site
http://mrcla.com/XonX/, this also a good site for some tips on XFree86
downloads and installs.
An extra step is needed to get Xwindows to function in your system. You need to
add the following lines to your environment path:

 
        setenv PATH "${PATH}:/usr/X11R6/bin"
        setenv MANPATH "&{MANPATH}:/usr/X11R6/man"
 
This will add the executables and the man pages to your path.
These changes should be made editing the file /usr/share/init/tcsh/path, so
that every user can benefit from them.
 
Step 6
Download the SU package from http://www.cwp.mines.edu/cwpcodes/index.html to
your /your/root/path/ directory and follow the instructions presented in the
README_BEFORE_UNTARRING file.

 
Step 7
To set the CWPROOT environment variable - Darwin uses the tcsh shell - you have
again to edit the file /usr/share/init/tcsh/path and add the following line:
 
        setenv CWPROOT /your/root/path
 
Step 8
To add /your/root/path/bin to your working shell path, you need to add the
following line to the file /usr/share/init/tcsh/path:
 
        setenv PATH "${PATH}:/your/root/path/bin"

 
Step 9
I have also found that, in order for Xwindows to recognize your path and the
CWPROOT variable, you also need to create the .tcshrc file in your home
directory since Xwindows will not read the /usr/share/init/tcsh/path file. The
.tcshrc should contain the following two lines:
 
        setenv PATH "${PATH}:/your/root/path/bin"
        setenv CWPROOT /your/root/path
 
Step 10
Untar and uncompress the compressed tarfiles containing the codes in
/your/root/path.
 
Step 11
You need to make the following changes in the
/your/root/path/src/Makefile.config:
a) In the Make section:
        comment the line that reads:
             include $(CWPROOT)/src/Rules/oldmake.rules and uncomment the line
that reads:
                     include $(CWPROOT)/src/Rules/gnumake.rules
b) In the Library section:
uncomment the line that reads:
             LD_LIBRARY_PATH += $(CWPROOT)/lib:/usr/X11R6/lib:/usr/local/lib
c) In the C preprocessor (cpp) section:
        change the line that reads:

             CPP = /usr/bin/cpp
d) In the Fortran materials section:
        uncomment the line that reads:
             OPTF = -O
        comment the line that reads:
                     OPTF = -O -static -m486 -ansi -fno-globals ...
e) In the Fortran compiler section:
        comment the line that reads:
                     FC = f77
        uncomment the line that reads:
                     FC = g77
f) In the Xwindows section:
        comment the lines that read:
                     IX11 = /usr/local/include
                     LX11 = /usr/local/lib
        uncomment the lines that read:
                     IX11 = /usr/X11R6/include
                     LX11 = /usr/X11R6/lib
Save the file.
 
Step 12
Install the codes.
The codes should install with no problem.
 
Step 13
You won't be able to install the X-toolkit using "make xtinstall" nor even
using "make xtremake" (I didn't).
The solution to get the X tools to compile is to run the
/your/root/path/src/xplot/Makefile.

 
Step 14
The installation of the Fortran codes will end with an error when installing
the Triso package. The other codes will install with no problem.
 
Now you have SU up and running on a Mac. Enjoy.

---- below is another set of instructions from Chris Liner of U-Tulsa

Anyway, what you have to do to install su on osx is the following:

1. Get the developer tools cd from the apple web site and install
    everything on it (compilers, etc).  Be sure your version of osx
    and developer tools is in sync, or you will get compile-time
    errors that halt the su install process.
2. get fink from   http://fink.sourceforge.net/   this is a utility for
   downloading packages to osx
2a. in a terminal window type
      fink g77 install
      and watch for about 30 minutes while fink installs the gnu fortran 
compiler.
3. install X11.... I use a commercial product called Xtools ($99) from
    http://www.tenon.com/products/xtools/
    there is also an xfree-86 package now available form the Apple web 
site,
    but I have not tried it since I am completely happy with xtools
4. download and install su, including X and Fortran codes (the codes that
    rely on openGL will not compile, but I have not really pursued this)
5. Since pdf is the native image format for osx, it makes sense to convert
    su postscript output to pdf using the command line utility ps2pdf.  
    To get this on your system, go to
     http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html
     and download texshop.  When you run the install for texshop there is
     an option to just install ghostscript (which includes ps2pdf).  Do 
this
     limited install and you will have ps2pdf.  By the way, I have tried
     several times to do a full install of texshop and test drive it (I 
write in
     LaTEX)... but I have never been able to get texshop to work.
     The way you use ps2pdf is
      ps2pdf myfile.ps
      which will create myfile.pdf that can be previewed by double clicking.
      This works properly for postscript movies as well... very nice.

That's it.  Good luck.

Hi John, Just wanted to let you know that I got SU compiled on Mac OS X 
on a 64 bit G5. Ran into one problem I wanted to let you know about.

The header file sysmacros.h does not exist on OS X. I used 
<sys/types.h>. Also I had to compile par/lib/filestat.c with 
_POSIX_SOURCE turned off so that I could get the file stat flags from 
<sys/stat.h>.

Thanks for the great work!

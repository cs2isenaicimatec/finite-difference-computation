README APOLLO                        11 July 1994

This file is based on the installation experience of Chris Liner
at the University of Tulsa. On his system, operating system is Domain_OS
version 10.4, with a systype of BSD4.3.  The C compiler is version 6.9. 

1) If you are installing the codes under a distributed file system 
   directory path, i.e. a path beginning with //, then the CWPROOT
   environment variable will not be transmitted from Makefile.config
   properly. You will have to put the line:

         CWPROOT = //your/root/path

   in Makefile.config and in *every* Makefile in the distribution.
   Place this after the line

         include $(CWPROOT)/src/Makefile.config

   that appears in each Makefile.

   Note:
   One thing that you might try  that might help you avoid editing all
   those Makefiles is to have your system administrator
   make a symbolic link  of the form:

	ln -s // /Mount

   and try setting the path   /Mount/your/root/path as the CWPROOT
   path in your working shell. I would be interested in finding out
   if that works.

3) You may get a conflict for a number of the "string" related C functions,
   when doing % make xtinstall.
   You may fix this by editing $(CWPROOT)/src/cwp/include/cwp.h.
   Comment out the line
	#include <string.h>
   and type 
        % make 
   in the $(CWPROOT)/src/cwp/include directory. cd $CWPROOT/src
   and type: 
        % make xtremake    to continue compilation.
  
   If you get errors from 'ld' complaining about not being able to
   find X11 and Xt, then check to see that the IX11 and LX11 paths
   are set correctly in Makefile.config.

README_RS6000						22 June 1995

Installation under RS6000 should be straightforward.

You may use the default settings in Makefile.config,
OPTC = -O

or:
OPTC = -O -DIBMRS6000

or you may use more advanced settings. For example

OPTC = -O3 -qlanglv=ansi -DIBMRS6000


Other examples are given in Makefile.config.

The following notes were submitted by long-time SU developer and
friend Craig Artley of Golden Geophysical Corp regarding
the installation on IBM RS6000 using the xlc compiler.


Installation of CWP/SU release 25, Craig Artley, 12/17/94

------------------
Configuration:
.../src/Makefile.config:
OPTC = -O3 -qhsflt -qlanglv=ansi -s

make install	# clean
make xtinstall	# many warnings, but everything compiles and runs
make xminstall	# many warnings, but everything compiles and runs

I think these were the things you said you cleaned up for release 26.

------------------
The fftlab app-defaults file is not installed.  Fix the makefile as follows:
.../src/Xmcwp/main/Makefile:
Change from:
XAPPDEFS =		\
		Fftlab
to:
XAPPDEFS =		\
		$R/Fftlab

------------------
xpsp.c is not included in the distribution.  Copying the source to
.../src/xplot/main and invoking "make $CWPROOT/bin/xpsp" does the trick,
as the Makefile does contain the necessary rule.  Fortunately I had the
source to xpsp.c.  I'm not sure if I ever installed this version of it
at school anyway.  I will mail you the latest source (from Hale, as
given to me about a year ago) in case your copy is out-of-date or
missing.  And I recommend you delete xepsb.c and xepsp.c from the
distribution while you are in there.

------------------
Note:  First tried to use
	CC = xlc -D_POSIX_SOURCE
	OPTC = -O3 -qhsflt -s
but had many problems, starting in par.  These flags invoke the true
ansi flavor of the AIX C compiler.  "cc" under AIX actually throws the
-qlanglvl=extended switch.  You might want to investigate why "cc" works
but "xlc" does not.  See /etc/xlc.cfg for what switches are thrown by
the various flavors of cc, xlc, c89, etc.  Try using -v option to see
with which options the compiler is actually being invoked.  Though this
clearly isn't a high priority, it might help you improve portability.

------------------
Third Party notes:  I tried out John Anderson's ProMAX/SU tools.  I
think you must have tweaked the source he provided you, but I bet you
didn't try compiling afterwards (understandable, because that would mean
you would have to learn Advance's gmake/Makeexec system).  Compilation
via Makeexec fails.  By looking at John's source on the RS/6000 net I
was able to figure out the problem.  Briefly, you have to change the
include blocks to look like this for both suread.c and suwrite.c:

#include     "segy.h"
#include     "header.h"
#include     "sumap.h"
#include     <cpromax.h>
#include     <pwd.h>

The key difference from what you have in the distribution is the absence
of su.h.  Bad things happen because this ends of including cwp.h which
causes conflicts with a bunch of stuff in agfc.h (Advance Geophysical
Fundamental C library).  That's no coincidence because Advance cloned
cwp.h.  The other important difference is that the segy.h that you need
to include is NOT the one from $(CWPROOT)/include!  You have to strip
out everything after the segy and bhed structure definitions.  The
following #define's and prototypes interact badly with ProMAX.  I think
that's pretty clear, but I'll mail you the fixed segy.h just to be sure.
In the future, you'll probably want change the name and distribute it
with John's stuff, or at least include these instructions.  (The
header.h can be the one from $(CWPROOT)/include.)

Once I figured out these two things, I was able to compile and link
these tools into a ProMAX executive via gmake/Makeexec, just like any
other ProMAX flow tools.

By the way, they work great!  Makes ProMAX almost palatable!

README for Open BSD                                   4 October 2009

Thanks to Kevin Rakos of Earth Signal Processing in Canada
for the information that follows.

The following instructions are for the Open BSD operating system.

Has been tested on the following Open BSD versions: 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6
using AMD and Intel processors.

To install on a Open BSD system, you will probably have to do
the following:

Install GNU Make if you have not already:

pkg_add -iv gmake


Relevant entries in Makefile.config:

Uncomment LITTLE_ENDIAN flag:

# Use this ENDIANFLAG for PC and DEC products (Linux PC's and the like)
ENDIANFLAG = -DCWP_LITTLE_ENDIAN


Set MAKE =    to whatever you are calling "GNU Make" on your system:

########################################################################
# standard make line; change only if you are using a different 'make'
MAKE = gmake

Is "gcc" different from "cc" on your system, if so set CC = accordingly:

########################################################################
# C compiler; change this only if you are using a different C-compiler
CC = gcc


Uncomment LD_LIBRARY_PATH line:

# under SUN OS and Linux  uncomment the next line
LD_LIBRARY_PATH += $(CWPROOT)/lib


Set CPP =    to the appropriate path:

#############################################################################
# C preprocessor (cpp) definition
# use this under IRIX if using the native cc compiler
#CPP = /lib/cpp

CPP = /usr/bin/cpp       (check to see if it really is there, use 'which' to get path)


Set the following for large file support: 

# uncomment if you want to install with large file support
# other platforms (non GNU source)
LARGE_FILE_FLAG =  -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE


Set Compile Flags:

# O3 optimization 
# OpenBSD 
OPTC = -O3 -Wall  

Set the X include and library paths to reflect the locations of
these on your system:

####
## The following paths would be used under Linux
## and possibly under SCO Unix installs
## On some systems you may need to make the symbolic link:
##                # ln -s /usr/X11R6 /usr/X386 
# X11 include path
IX11 = /usr/X11R6/include

# X11 library path
LX11 = /usr/X11R6/lib
####

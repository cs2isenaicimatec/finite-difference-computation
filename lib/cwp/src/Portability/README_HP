README_HP						8 March 1996

This message is from  Einar Kjartansson of
the National Energy Authority of Iceland, (also a founding father
of SU).
>>>> begin message <<<<<<
I have installed the SU programs on a HP 9000/735 
using standard HP setup.
This diffs for ./src/Makefile.config 
are as follows:

82c82
< #OPTC = -O -s
---
> OPTC = -O -s
93c93
< OPTC = -O -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE
---
> #OPTC = -O -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE
210c210
< IX11 = /usr/include/X11R5
---
> IX11 = /usr/local/include
213c213
< LX11 = /usr/lib/X11R5
---
> LX11 = /usr/local/lib

This gets everything to compile except the .src/Xmcwp directory
Adding the line :

CFLAGS = -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -I $(CWPROOT)/include -I /usr/include/Motif1.2 \
        -$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(@F).c $(LDFLAGS) -o $@

to the makefiles in ./src/Xmcwp/main and ./src/Xmcwp/lib
got fftlab to compile. It would be simple to add hooks between the Makfiles
and ./src/Makefile.config so all the changes could be make in one file.
If you make those changes, I will be glad to try them out.

Additional information from:  Mark Morehead of the University of Colorado
Regarding HPUX 10.00:

>>>>> beginning of a message <<<< 
I was able to install SEISUNIX on our machine after some work.
It turns out that the HP-C compiler that comes with HPUX 10.00
has some errors in the optimizer.  These have not been fixed,
though HP is aware of them. In the end, my successful installation
followed the README_HP file from Einar Kjartansson, with the following
changes (HP also changed the location of some of the X11 files for 10.00):


original:
OPTC = -O -Aa -D _HPUX_SOURCE
IX11 = /usr/include/X11R5
LX11 = /usr/lib/X11R5

mine:
OPTC = +O1 -Aa -D _HPUX_SOURCE
IX11 = /usr/include
LX11 = /usr/lib/X11R5


>>>> end message <<<<<<



There are subroutines that is used in CWPROOT/su/main/segyread.c
and  CWPROOT/su/main/segywrite.c called 
ibm_to_float and float_to_ibm
that need to be changed for these codes to work on HP.

In ../su/main/Portability, there is a file called conv_float.c.hp
that contains HP compatible versions of these subroutines. Use these
to hack segyread.c and segywrite.c.

I would appreciate it greatly if some HP users would send me
more complete information on their installation experiences
with our codes so we can update the information in this file.

After making these changes, as well as  any others that are
appropriate for your system, follow the compilation instructions
in README_TO_INSTALL.

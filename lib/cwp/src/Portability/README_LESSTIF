LESSTIF 				31 July 1997

There is a free alternative to Motif called "Lesstif" which
is now available and works. It may be obtained from:

http://www.lesstif.org/

ftp.lesstif.org

I recently installed the CWP/SU  "xminstall" portion (the program
is fftlab) on a Linux system after the simple 5 step installation
for that platform.

1) Download the precompiled binary lesstif libraries and include files
2) Uncompress and untar this archive in the  path /usr/local  which
   produces  the directory:   /usr/local/lesstif
3) edit the file:  /etc/ld.so.conf   by simply adding the line:
   /usr/local/lesstif/lib    in the listing of shared library paths
4) As root, type:    /sbin/ldconfig -v
5) Uncommenting the  "Lesstif" IMOTIF and LMOTIF paths in Makefile.config
   simply type:    make  xminstall

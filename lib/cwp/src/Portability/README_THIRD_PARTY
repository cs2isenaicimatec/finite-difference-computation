README_THIRD_PARTY						8 March 1995


The following notes were submitted by long-time SU developer and
friend Craig Artley of Golden Geophysical Corp regarding
the installation on IBM RS6000 using the xlc compiler.


from Installation of CWP/SU release 25, Craig Artley, 12/17/94

------------------
Third Party notes:  I tried out John Anderson's ProMAX/SU tools.  I
think you must have tweaked the source he provided you, but I bet you
didn't try compiling afterwards (understandable, because that would mean
you would have to learn Advance's gmake/Makeexec system).  Compilation
via Makeexec fails.  By looking at John's source on the RS/6000 net I
was able to figure out the problem.  Briefly, you have to change the
include blocks to look like this for both suread.c and suwrite.c:

#include     "segy.h"
#include     "header.h"
#include     "sumap.h"
#include     <cpromax.h>
#include     <pwd.h>

The key difference from what you have in the distribution is the absence
of su.h.  Bad things happen because this ends of including cwp.h which
causes conflicts with a bunch of stuff in agfc.h (Advance Geophysical
Fundamental C library).  That's no coincidence because Advance cloned
cwp.h.  The other important difference is that the segy.h that you need
to include is NOT the one from $(CWPROOT)/include!  You have to strip
out everything after the segy and bhed structure definitions.  The
following #define's and prototypes interact badly with ProMAX.  I think
that's pretty clear, but I'll mail you the fixed segy.h just to be sure.
In the future, you'll probably want change the name and distribute it
with John's stuff, or at least include these instructions.  (The
header.h can be the one from $(CWPROOT)/include.)

Once I figured out these two things, I was able to compile and link
these tools into a ProMAX executive via gmake/Makeexec, just like any
other ProMAX flow tools.

By the way, they work great!

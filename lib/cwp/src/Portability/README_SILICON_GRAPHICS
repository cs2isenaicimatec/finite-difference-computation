README SILICON GRAPHICS				14 August 1995

The CWP/SU codes will install under IRIX using either the
cc compiler that comes with IRIX or with the gcc compiler.

Thanks to Jim Schatzman of the University of Wyoming for
supplying the following information regarding his install
on an SGI machine under IRIX 6.0. I have emplemented many
of his fixes, but many still remain to be done:

The following are general instructions for an IRIX install:

Change for installation under cc:

Change  --- RANLIB definition
Change:
# under IRIX (Silicon Graphics), you probably will have
# to use this line for RANLIB
#RANLIB = ar -ts

To:
# under IRIX (Silicon Graphics), you probably will have
# to use this line for RANLIB
RANLIB = ar -ts

Then "make install"  installs the codes without a problem.

>You will get plenty of warnings about "xargc and xargv" being multiply
>defined. These are global variables defined in src/par/par.h. Apparently,
>the SGI machine's versions of "ar" and "cc" are bothered by the
>fact that a global variable is defined multiple times in libpar.a. 
>It honors the intent of these variables, though,
>so the code will compile successfully.

I believe that this has been fixed in release 27.

You may have warnings about "incompatible types" when doing
xtinstall and xminstall (or xtremake and xmremake) but the
code should run ok in spite of this.

Changes for installation under GCC:
Change 1 --- CC line definition
Change:

########################################################################
# C compiler; change this only if you are using a different C-compiler
CC = cc

To:
########################################################################
# C compiler; change this only if you are using a different C-compiler
CC = gcc

Note: make sure that the 'gcc' is on your shell path, otherwise you
      will need to use   CC = /full/path/to/gcc   instead.


Change 2 --- RANLIB definition
Change:
# under IRIX (Silicon Graphics), you probably will have
# to use this line for RANLIB
#RANLIB = ar -ts

To:
# under IRIX (Silicon Graphics), you probably will have
# to use this line for RANLIB
RANLIB = ar -ts

Change 3 --- CPP definition
Change:
# under Solaris and IRIX, with gcc compiler, use
#CPP = gcc -E

To:
# under Solaris and IRIX, with gcc compiler, use
CPP = gcc -E

Then "make install"  installs the codes without a problem.

>xtinstall and xminstall (or xtremake and xmremake) but the
>code should run ok.
**I have fixed many of these, but more may still remain.-JWS

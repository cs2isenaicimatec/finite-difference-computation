Update  22 Feb 2010

On a recent install under Ubuntu I found that
in the synaptic package manager, you need to install
all of the packages with "gcc" and "dev" and for Xwindows
you need to instal:

      libx11-dev
      lesstif2-dev
      libxmu-dev
      glut3-dev
      libxi-dev

to be able to install everything in SU.

Here are some instructions for UBUNTU installation.

First of all, the default installation under UBUNTU Linux requires
that a number of developers' materials be installed.

sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential

sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install x-window-system-dev
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
sudo apt-get install g77

alternately:
sudo apt-get install libxt-dev
sudo apt-get install dx
sudo apt-get build-dep dx

sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install libglut3-dev
sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev

Find out where UBUNTU keeps its X11 include and lib files and
change IX11= and LX11= accordingly.


Makefile.config settings are 
similar to other linux, except Debian is not yet Posix compliant,
so use this OPTC in Makefile.config. All other Linux settings should
be used.

# O3 optimization full ansi non-Posix compliant systems
# this includes Mac OS X and CYGWIN32
OPTC = -O3 -Wall -ansi -pedantic

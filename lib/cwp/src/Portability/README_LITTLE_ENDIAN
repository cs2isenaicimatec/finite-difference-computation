README_LITTLE_ENDIAN					5 June 1995

To install on a little endian machine (PC's running UNIX or
DEC machines) you will need to make this change:

In Makefile.config uncomment the ENDIANFLAG line for the LITTLE ENDIAN
case.

If you are making data with xwigb on a machine with a different endian
from the machine you are using for your remote X host, do the following:

% xwigb < data.su  endian=HOSTENDIAN

where HOSTENDIAN =0 if your remote host is a little endian machine
or =1 if it is bigendian.


(Note: all of the code hacking that was required to install pre-Release 27
versions of the CWP/SU package on little endian platforms has been eliminated.)

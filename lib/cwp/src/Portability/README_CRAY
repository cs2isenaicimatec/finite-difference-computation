XDR README				31 March 1998

The XDR routines are library functions that are used for portable
eXternal Data Representation. These library functions are used
as part of network filesystem (NFS), and should be available
on most, if not all Unix and Unix-like systems. 

(1) The XDR codes are now optionally included by setting the -DSUXDR
compiler flag.  They are not included if that flag is not set
yielding compilations as they were before.

Modifications are in su/include su/lib and su/main directories.
Grep for "su_xdr.h" to find files that have been modified.

Tested so far: 
(a) File formats read/written by fgettr/fputtr transport ok
between SUN, Cray T3E, and Linux which tests 32 bit, 64 bit, and big and
little endian formats.
(b) Segyread and segywrite work ok with -DSUXDR set everywhere tested.
They do not work ok on T3E if the flag is not set.  I put the code
to convert ascii to ebcdic and vice versa as inline routines.
(c) I'm not sure about segdread.  The version that came with version 31 
did not compile ok on T3E or my Linux box.  I built an old version and
left it at that for the time being.

(2) All of the script files now test to see if the environmental
variable $CWPSRC is set.  If not, they set it equal to $CWPROOT.
They use the $CWPSRC/src directory for source code and documentation.
This allows optional builds for different machines from the same
source code directory.  A user can optionally set only CWPROOT
and all still works as before.

To compile binaries in a machine specific location, you

setenv CWPROOT machine_directory  ($CWPROOT/bin will be executables...)
setenv CWPSRC source_director  (put src/...   tree here)

mkdir $CWPROOT/src
cp $CWPSRC/src/Makefile.config $CWPROOT/src
vi $CWPROOT/src/Makefile.config  and set up your defines for the build
cd $CWPSRC/src
make install

To build for another machine, redefine $CWPROOT, fix up
$CWPROOT/src/Makefile.config and enter "make remake"

You can also do this to test versions with and without XDR
from the same source directory.  Please incorporate these changes
to help with system administration.

(3) On the T3E, the C compiler has a builtin complex data type.  
I modified cwp.h to have cwp complex types defined as cwp_complex 
rather than complex to make everything work properly.  That requires 
the compiler flag -DCRAY to be operationally different than before.

(4) I added to the src/su/main/Makefile so that a script,
csu, can be automatically generated that can compile and link single SU codes.
 
(5) The upgrade on Linux to RedHat 5.0 needed some debugging to
get my development environment back in place.  That is not an
SU question but a warning that the upgrade to the LibC object
library environment requires a little care.

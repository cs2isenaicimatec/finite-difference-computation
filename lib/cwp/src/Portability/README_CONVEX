README Convex						14 August 1995	

The following are notes from an install of the 16 Dec 1992
version of the CWP codes on a CONVEX C220 by:


Jan-Willem de Bruijn
Lab. of Seismics & Acoustics
Dep. of Applied Physics,
Delft University of Technology, Delft, the Netherlands

1) You will need to use GNU make to do the install. See README_GNU_MAKE
   for further information.


2) So on to the errors on a CONVEX:

=======================================================================
cd ./cwp; gmake ROOT="/usr/local/cwp" OPTC="-O3"
cd lib     ; gmake ROOT=/usr/local/cwp OPTC=-O3 ROOT="/usr/local/cwp"
OPTC="-O3"
cc -c -O3 -I/usr/local/cwp/include conv.c
cc: Error on line 65 of conv.c: function 'convs' may not be declared 'static'
in block scope

: Removed static keyword (using #ifndef CONVEX).

cd main    ; gmake ROOT=/usr/local/cwp OPTC=-O3 ROOT="/usr/local/cwp"
OPTC="-O3"
cc -O3 -I/usr/local/cwp/include newback.c -L/usr/local/cwp/lib -lcwp -s -o
/usr/local/cwp/bin/newback
cc: Warning on line 243 of /usr/include/sys/param.h: macro MIN redefined with
a new replacement list
cc: Warning on line 244 of /usr/include/sys/param.h: macro MAX redefined with
a new replacement list

: Reversed the order of the first two #include statements.



After making these changes, as well as  any others that are
appropriate for your system, follow the compilation instructions
in README_TO_INSTALL.

I could use some current info from a Convex user out there.

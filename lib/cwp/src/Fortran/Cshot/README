README for CSHOT

Make sure you have installed the  CWP/SU Free Seismic Unix package
available from: ftp.cwp.mines.edu    pub/cwpcodes
before attempting to install this code.

Caveat. I have noticed that there is a compiler bug on SGI that
causes cshot1 to have problems. This bug is only apparent if
optimization is used. If   Demo01 does not show a multi-layer
model, try recompiling the codes with  OPTF =     set to
nothing.

The Unix (tar) distribution includes the subdirectories Demo01, Demo02,
... containing usage examples similar to those in the original CSHOT
release notes.  Several of the Demos (02, 11, 12, 13, 14) highlight new
capabilities of CSHOT.  It is recommended that users copy these directories
to their own work areas in order to preserve the originals and keep
the Demo directories from getting cluttered.

***************************************************************
* Running the Xgraph or Psgraph files in a Demo directory,
* while reading the corresponding example in the Release Notes
* is the way to learn how to use CSHOT !!!
***************************************************************

The "graphics" in the new CSHOT consists of writing an ascii file
to stdout that contains groups headed by two integers giving
respectively the number of points in the curve and a color code,
followed by the (x, z) pairs of floats.

It is then easy to write a program to parse this file and do the
graphics with any local package or to change to a binary output format,
etc.  The program, cshotplot.c, distributed with CSHOT forms an example
of such a parser that, in turn, outputs binary data and a parameter file
that are the form that the CWP public domain graphics programs require.
Of course, to use this implementation you need to install the CWP
environment.  The files you need are available from CWP by anonymous
ftp (hilbert.Mines.Colorado.EDU or 138.67.22.6).  Just "cd pub", evoke
binary mode and take cwp.tar.Z, plot.tar.Z, xcwp.tar.Z and su.tar.Z 
(install in that order).

The Demo directories each contain the file, Xcshot, which is
as an example run file using CWP's xgraph to do the 
model/well/ray plots (if any) and xwigb to do the sections (if any). 
If you prefer grayscale plots to wiggles, replace "xwigb" by "ximage".
If you prefer PostScript to X, see the PScshot files in the Demo
directories--here at CWP, we use PostScript mainly for getting
hard copy, so you will have to make a few simple changes if you
want to use Display PostScript instead.

Paul Docherty is still interested in comments/bug reports on CSHOT and
I'll relay them to him.

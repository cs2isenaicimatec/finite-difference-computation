This example makes a ray plot and creates a listing.
You should remove old versions of the listing files (at present the
program will not write over old files with the same name).
The first part of the filenames for the listings comes from Record 10
of param1 - demo6 here.  Demo6listing is meant to be a readable file.
Demo6data is for input to another program - an x-t type plotting program
still to come.
Note how two shots were specified in file geometry2.

Note also that it was not possible to reproduce exactly Example 6 from
the old cshot documentation.  There are two differences.  First the
shots and receivers are tied to station locations in the new geometry
specification (i.e. in the geometry file).  In the original version of
cshot the shot moveup was arbitrary and shots did not have to be at station
locations.  The second difference is that cshot1 requires a minimum of 4
receivers to be specified per shot.  This is necessary in order to describe
a spread with a gap.

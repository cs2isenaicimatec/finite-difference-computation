Notes
-----
This example plots the model, plots the well and then quits.

(1) If you are doing VSP then you need to provide the coordinates
describing the well.  The program fits a spline through the well coordinates.
File curvedwell1 in Record 5 above contains the well description.
In order to plot the well, type a w in one of the first three
columns of Record 4. In this example we have m, w and q, so the program
plots the model, plots the well and then quits. To plot the well without
the model enter wq.

Update: The file dummygeo is a dummy geometry file that seems to be
        needed on some systems

Notes
-----

(1) When the upper surface is curved you may not know the elevation
at the x-coordinate of the top of the  well. The program calculates 
this for you -
hence you only provide the x-coordinate where the well meets the upper
surface.

(2) The well should not be too curvy, and must be single valued in z (ie it
can't turn back towards the upper surface).

README for the dynamic ray tracing from a lens velocity model.

The program RAYTRACE3D implements a ray-theoretical modeling 
method that uses smoothing of models, dynamic ray tracing
and wavefront construction.  All the quantities in the Kirchhoff
inversion formula can be determined by this program.

To run demo, 
Table		Build the forward modeling from a lens velocity
		model.  The traveltime, amplitude and phase shift
		index of the three different arrivals are computed.
Xplot		slices of modeling output
PSplot		slices of modeling output (PostScript plot)

RAYTRACE3D requires an input file (drt.inp) that the program can 
read the input parameters from the file. The following lists 
the parameters and their default values.

Notes:

The smoothness of velocity model representation is critical to the 
calculation of amplitudes. RAYTRACE3D does not include an internal
velocity smoother in the program. Therefore, smoothing procedure 
(e.g. application CWP code smooth3d) is recommaned to the velocity 
input specified by vx_file. If velocity input is not provided, 
RAYTRACE3D will take the values in parameters v0, vx, vy, vz to 
generate a linearly distributed background velocity model.

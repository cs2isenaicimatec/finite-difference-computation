Triso -- Sebastien Geoltrain's FORTRAN tranversely isotropic modeling code.
Preliminary update by Phil Anno  30 May 1992

This version of Triso differs from the original release only
that it no longer depends on the cplotlib graphics calls.

The program 'triview' depends on the CWP/SU Seismic Unix
package, available from ftp.cwp.mines.edu   pub/cwpcodes

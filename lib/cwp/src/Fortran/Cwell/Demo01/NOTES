                       DEMO01 - Model Plot

This demo produces a plot of the model and the quits.  Only 4 records are
required in file PARAM1 for this run....


syncline                            :model file
4                                   :#interfaces in model
plotcolors                          :model colors file
mq                                  :first plot descriptor (mq)


Record 1 of PARAM1 contains the name of the file decribing
the model; the file is called syncline here.  (See below for
a description of the format of the model file.)
Record 2 of PARAM1 gives the number of interfaces described
in the model file (not including the upper surface).
Next comes the name of a file describing the colors of various
elements of the plot.  It is possible, on a color screen, to plot
the interfaces, rays, source/receiver locations etc., in different
colors.  The colors are defined in file plotcolors in this demo.
A key is given at the end of the file.
The last record in PARAM1 for this run is a plot descriptor.
To get a plot of the model enter m here.  To quit immediately
after the model plot enter mq.


Format of the model file
________________________

An interface is described by a list of (x,z) coordinates, through
which the program fits a cubic spline.
The program expects to find descriptions for the upper surface and n
interfaces in the model file, where n is the integer in Record 2 
of PARAM1.  The program considers the upper surface to be Interface 0
and splines it just like the deeper interfaces.  The upper surface
should come first in the model file. 
An interface description is terminated by a large negative 
z-coordinate (z<-9999.).

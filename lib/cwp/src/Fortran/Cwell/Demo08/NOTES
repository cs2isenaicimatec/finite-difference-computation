This is the first demo in which wiggle traces are generated.  This
time it necessary to run program CSHOT2 in addition to CWELL.  CSHOT2
reads the time, amplitude and phase file output by CWELL and
actually constructs the traces.  Program CSHOT2 and its input parameter
file PARAM2 have been described in the CSHOT documentation. (For example,
see Demo08 in the CSHOT directory.)

In order to make time data enter t in Record 11 (to make rays as well
enter rt).  The time data file output by CWELL takes its name from
Record 12 of PARAM1.  Appended to this is .shot, so the file
will be called demo8.shot here.  This file name must be entered
in PARAM2 for CSHOT2.
Here we are generating data for one shot, direct wave and all primaries.

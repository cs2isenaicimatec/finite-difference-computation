                DEMO07 - Ray Plot - Listing

Here we are back in downhole mode (Record 7) with 3 source
locations (see file swell2), we have asked for
a reflection from interface 2 (Record 19), for a ray plot and a 
listing (Record 11).  The first part of the file name given to
the listing comes from Record 12.  Appended to this is .listing,
so the file generated here will be called demo7.listing.  The file
begins with a list of the source and receiver locations.  This is
followed by the intersection coordinates with the interfaces 
and the traveltime for each ray.
Note that the ray density has been reduced (Record 14) so as not to
make the listing too long.

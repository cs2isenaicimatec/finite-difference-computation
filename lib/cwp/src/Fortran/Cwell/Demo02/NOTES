In this demo plots are made of the model, the receiver well, and 
the receiver locations are plotted.  Two more records have been 
added to PARAM1...

syncline                            :model file
4                                   :#interfaces in model
plotcolors                          :model colors file
m                                   :first plot descriptor (mq)
rwell                               :receiver well coordinates
wgq                                 :receiver plot descriptor (wgq)

Record 5 of PARAM1 is the name of the file containing the receiver well
description.  This file, called rwell here, also specifies the receiver
locations (see below).  Record 6 of PARAM1 is another plot descriptor. 
To plot the receiver well enter w in Record 6.  To plot the receivers 
enter g (for geophones).  To plot both well and receivers enter wg.
You can also quit at this point by tagging on a q in Record 6.
(Notice how Record 4 has been changed to m - plot the model, do not
quit after plotting the model.)

Format of the well file
-----------------------
First in the well file are a list of (x,z) coordinates describing
the well.  The well may be curved (the coordinates will be splined
by the program) but should not be too curvy.  The first record
in the file contains the x-coordinate of the top of the well. The
program calculates the z-coordinate of the top of the well for
you (you may not know it if the upper surface is curved).
The well definition is terminated by a large negative z-coordinate.

Next in the well file is the depth (arc length) down the well to the 
first receiver location.  This is followed by the number of receivers
and the receiver spacing.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
*********************
To aid in bookkeeping the program assumes the following:

(1) The well intersects ALL interfaces in the model.
    Make sure you define the well so that it cuts through the
    deepest interface in the model.

(2) No receivers are located below the deepest interface.

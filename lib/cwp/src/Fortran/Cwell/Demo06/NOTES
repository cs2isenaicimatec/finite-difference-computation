Here we have switched to general shooting mode (Record 7 = g),
specified 2 source locations in file sources (Record 9), turned off
the source well plot (Record 10), and asked for a multiple reflection
event (Record 19).
Any number of events can be specified at the end of PARAM1. Multiple
bounce reflection and head wave events are allowed.  In this example,
the letter r in Column 1 of Record 19 specifies a multiple reflection.
(The other choice is h for multiple bounce head wave.  See Demo11 for
an example of this.)  The integers in Record 19 are the interface
numbers of the reflections; thus, Record 19 specifies bounces from
Interface 0 (the upper surface), Interface 2 and then Interface 1.

As with Record 19, each event is described by a list of interfaces
at which the ray reflects.

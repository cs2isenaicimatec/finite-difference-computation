Here we have plots of the model, receiver well+geophone locations,
and source well+source locations.  Four records have been added to 
PARAM1...

First, in Record 7, is the shooting mode.  This is either d, for
downhole, or g for general.  The receivers are always located inside
the receiver well, but there is a choice for locating the sources.
In downhole mode, the sources are distributed throughout a source well;
thus, we must provide a source well description (see below).
The name of the file describing the source well and source locations
is given in Record 8 of PARAM1.
In the general shooting mode (Record 7 = g) the sources are not 
confined to a well, but can be anywhere in the model.
In this case, a file containing a list of the source (x,z) coordinates
is provided. The name of the source file is given in Record 9 of PARAM1.
(See Demo06 for an example of the general shooting mode.)

Record 10 of PARAM1 is a plot descriptor for the sources.  Enter
w here to get a plot of the source well, s for the source locations,
and/or q to quit at this point.

Format of the Source Well File (Downhole Mode)
----------------------------------------------
The format of this file is the same as that for the receiver well:

3000.                           :x-coord. of top of source well
5000.  6000.
1.   -99999.                    :end of source well definition
500.                            :depth to first source
1       500.                    :#sources, source spacing

Format of Source Description (General Mode)
-------------------------------------------
This file simply contains a list of source locations:

x1, z1                          :location of source 1
x2, z2                          :location of source 2
...
...
xn, zn                          :location of source n

!!! Be sure to adjust ROOT in the Makefile before installing !!!

!! There is a collection of C programs accompanying Cwell that
   require libraries in the    CWP   and   PAR   release packages.
   If you have not installed these, then make the appropriate
   change indicated in the Makefile before proceeding. Cwell,
   itself, consists of 2 FORTRAN programs that do *not* depend on these
   libraries.

!  Also note that the shells in the Demo directories depend
   heavily on CWP's  SU Seismic UNIX package as well as the,
   XCWP release codes for graphics. 

The Unix (tar) distribution includes the subdirectories Demo01, Demo02,
... containing usage examples similar to those in the original CWELL
release notes.  Several of the Demos (02, 11, 12, 13, 14) highlight new
capabilities of CWELL.  It is recommended that users copy these directories
to their own work areas in order to preserve the originals and keep
the Demo directories from getting cluttered.

***************************************************************
* Running the Xgraph or Psgraph files in a Demo directory,
* while reading the corresponding example in the Release Notes
* is the way to learn how to use CWELL !!!
***************************************************************

The "graphics" in the new CWELL consists of writing an ascii file
to stdout that contains groups headed by two integers giving
respectively the number of points in the curve and a color code,
followed by the (x, z) pairs of floats.

It is then easy to write a program to parse this file and do the
graphics with any local package or to change to a binary output format,
etc.  The program, cwellplot.c, distributed with CWELL forms an example
of such a parser that, in turn, outputs binary data and a parameter file
that are the form that the CWP public domain graphics programs require.
Of course, to use this implementation you need to install the CWP
environment.  The files you need are available from CWP by anonymous
ftp (hilbert.Mines.Colorado.EDU or 138.67.22.6).  Just "cd pub", evoke
binary mode and take cwp.tar.Z, plot.tar.Z, xcwp.tar.Z and su.tar.Z 
(install in that order).

The Demo directories each contain the file, Xcwell, which is
as an example run file using CWP's xgraph to do the 
model/well/ray plots (if any) and xwigb to do the sections (if any). 
If you prefer grayscale plots to wiggles, replace "xwigb" by "ximage".
If you prefer PostScript to X, see the PScwell files in the Demo
directories--here at CWP, we use PostScript mainly for getting
hard copy, so you will have to make a few simple changes if you
want to use Display PostScript instead.

Paul Docherty is still interested in comments/bug reports on CWELL and
I'll relay them to him.

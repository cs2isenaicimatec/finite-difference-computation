README for CXZCS Demo4 -- The Syncline Model

The shell script Model creates a synthetic common shot seismic
section using the program CSHOT and displays both the earth model and
seismic section.

The shell script Inversion inverts the synthetic data created by Model
using CXZCS. The results are, respectively, the result of inverting
for the reflectivity function,  R, and the reflectivity function multiplied
by the cosine of the angle of incidence,  R cos(theta).

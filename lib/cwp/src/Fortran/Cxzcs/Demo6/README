README for CXZCS Demo6 -- The Marathon Model

The shell script Model creates a synthetic common shot seismic
section using the program CSHOT and displays both the earth model and
seismic section.

The shell script Inversion inverts the synthetic data created by Model
using CXZCS. The results are, respectively, the result of inverting
for the reflectivity function,  R, and the reflectivity function multiplied
by the cosine of the angle of incidence,  R cos(theta).
The inversion is not of the entire model, but only of a relatively
flat portion, because the data will be used for determining the
full angularly dependent reflection coefficient R.

The last portion of the demo is a comparison of the angularly 
dependent reflection R coefficient extracted from the inverted data
with the theoretical values computed from the traditional formula. 
See README.inversion for details.

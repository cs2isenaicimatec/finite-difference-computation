README for CXZCS -- U13R -- Zhen-yue Liu's revision of
Wenji Dong's FORTRAN 2.5D common shot c(x,z) inversion code.

Within the  Demo1 and Demo2 directories are the shell scripts 
called Xcshot and PScshot show the user how to
the CWP program CSHOT is used to create model seismic data that CXZCS will
invert in Demo3, Demo4, Demo5, and Demo6.
In Demo3-6, there are shell scripts called Model and Inversion
that, respectively, create model seismic data with CSHOT and then
invert this data with CXZCS.

For this demo to run, the user must first install the following
CWP codes:   

G001: cwp,par    Jack K. Cohen's C language CWP scientific code.
G002: plot,xcwp  Dave Hale's C and X-windows graphics libraries and mains.

U08R: cshot  Paul Docherty's FORTRAN 2.5D common shot modeling code, revised.

Q. What are these funny words gelev, selev, fldr, etc. that I see
   in various places?

A. These are the "keywords" that are required for many of the codes.
   They refer to SU (Segy) header fields.

   Type:   sukeyword -o                to see the whole list 
   Type:   sukeyword keyword           to see the listing for an individual
                                       keyword

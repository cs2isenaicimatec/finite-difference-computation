Q:  How do I convert data that are in the SEG-2 format to SEGY?

A:  In   $CWPROOT/src/Third_Party/seg2segy   there are two programs
    that have been made available to us by the University of Pau
    in France, for this purpose. These should be easy to install
    on any system with a C-compiler.

    Once you have converted   data.seg2  to  data.segy, you may
    read it into the SU format via:

    % segyread tape=data.segy > data.su

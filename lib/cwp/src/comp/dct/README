This directory contains the programs used in the research of seismic
data compression. Each of the subdirectory is described briefly below:

include		contains the the header files

lib		contains the functions for different transforms,
		including Wavelet Transform, Wavelet Packet Transform,
		Discrete Cosine Transform, Local Cosine Transform,
		as well as the lateral prediction approach

libutil		contains the utilities (functions) necessary for compresion,
		including quantization, run-lengh coding, escape character
		based prefix coding, as well as huffman coding

main		contains the research version of the compression programs

src		contains the main programs of simply applying the transforms	
		without any compression

tools		contains the tools for entropy evaluation, RMS calculation, etc.

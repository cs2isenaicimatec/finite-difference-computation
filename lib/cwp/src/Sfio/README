This directory contains the following:

Standard directories:
	./bin		for generated executables
	./include	for package header files
	./lib		for constructed libraries
	./man		for manual pages
	./src		for source code of packages

Package directories:
	./src/lib/vthread
	./src/lib/sfio

Before building a package, you should add the above "bin" directory
to your PATH environment variable. In most shell environments, the
PATH variable can be set as follows:

	PATH=$PATH:$PWD/bin

Changing the PATH variable as shown makes available the command "iffe"
which is invoked by the "make" command while it builds the package(s).
Iffe (IF Features Exist) is the interpreter of the IFFE language used
to define probes for any configuration parameters needed from the local
platform that you are building the software on. Examples of such probes
can be found in the sub-directory "features" in each package directory.
The iffe command carries its own documentation. Its manual pages can be
obtained in either text or html forms as follows:

	iffe --man
	iffe --html


The simplest way to build everything is to invoke the script "Runmake"
available in this directory. Each package directory also has a README
file that explains the local directory hierarchy and may give specific
directions to build and test the respective package.

Let me know of any problems. Good luck and have fun.

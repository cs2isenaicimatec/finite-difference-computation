This is the CWP/SU implementation of the Sfio materials.   25 Sept 2000 

You should simply be able to type:    make
in this directory to install everything.
However, you may need to type:     make remake

This was built from  sfio2000. The only changes that have been made
from the original sfio is the addition of

./Makefile
./lib/Makefile
./include/Makefile
./main
./main/Makefile
./main/segdread.c

All other Makefiles
were edited so that these will inherit the definitions of $(AR) and $(RANLIB)
from $(CWPROOT)/src/Makefile.config file that is part of the CWP/SU
distribution.

SEGDREAD -  Read an SEG-D tape
source code: ./main/segdread.c
This version differs from the version in $CWPROOT/src/su/main/segdread.c
in that the SUXDR flag is set to permit the code to be built 
with Stew Levin's XDR libraries, as well as the sfio libraries. 
The version in $(CWPROOT)/src/su/main   has the sfio related 
items fenced off with a dummy compile-time flag.

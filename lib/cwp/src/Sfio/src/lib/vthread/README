This directory contains the source code for the Vthread library.
Despite the promise of the Posix pthread interface, multi-threading
is still a haphazard as far as portable programming is concerned.
For this reason, Vthread provides a set of functions for portable
threads including mutex handling. Vthread is known to run on all
known Unix flavors including Linux, BSD, Irix, HPUX, Solaris, etc.
and all known Window versions.


DIRECTORY HIERARCHY:

. :		source code for Vthread
./features:	source code for generating configuration parameters.
./Vthread_t:	regression tests.

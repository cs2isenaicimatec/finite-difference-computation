Fixed sumax bug that caused core dumps (garbage initialization) (02/20/91)

suximage, suxwigb, supsimage, supsxwigb, supswigp updated (02/22/91)
psgraph, xgraph updated by Craig (02/22/91)

sushw default of j changed from 1 to ULONG_MAX so that a=100 b=100
generates 100,200,300,... instead of 100,100,100,... (02/22/91)

I said last time that users had no good way to set the new
float fields f1,d1,f2,d2.  But actually, sushw works just
as well with floats as with ints.  Still, at present, only
the plotting programs are looking for these fields.

Thanks to Mei-Ying Cheng for checking up on using the new fields.

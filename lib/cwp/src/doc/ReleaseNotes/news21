CWP Software Update: 09/23/93  (21th edition)

The new compressed tars are available at our anonymous ftp Internet address:
hilbert.mines.colorado.edu
or
138.67.12.63
The directory path is: pub/cwpcodes	

**** The install procedure is again simplified and now includes
**** GNU make support.  Some support for LINUX and SOLARIS added.

Removed:
pgen.c
newback.c 

Modified:
pscontour - permits labeling of the contours. This change propagates
	automatically to supscontour. (Jonathan Liu)

segyread and segywrite - regressed to earlier version.  There were stubs
	in for machines that have 2 byte shorts and/or 4 byte longs.
	But mysterious errors that smelled like misdirected pointers
	showed up that went away when I removed the stubs.  If you'd
	like to take this as a challenge, let me know and I will send
	the codes involved and the test harness that revealed the
	problem.  Thanks to Manabu Tanahashi (tana@gsj.go.jp) for
	pointing out the problem and doing some testing for us.

A few codes in par/lib/errpkge had:
extern int errno;
this caused a conflict with compilers that declare it
extern volatile int errno;
and, as Tom Schutter (tom%crete@platte.com) points out,
ANSI C has it declared in errno.h,
so it shouldn't have been in our source to begin with.
Alas, I don't remember exactly which codes I changed ... (jkc)

The following typedefs were changed to diminish the chance of collision:
	String -> SU_String
	Bool -> SU_Bool
Thanks to Wences (wgouveia@dix.Mines.Colorado.EDU) for pointing
out this problem (in connection with a graphical X debugger).

su.h: Added #defines for other SEG-Y traces ids (TDEAD, TDUMMY, ...)
Thanks to Antonio Ramos (cramos@elbert.mines.colorado.edu) for pointing
out this need.

psplot, xplot codes now accept TDEAD and TDUMMY as seismic time traces

New Code:
h2b   by Craig Artley and John Stockwell
Converts 8 bit hexidecimal to binary
(The inverse of psgraph.)

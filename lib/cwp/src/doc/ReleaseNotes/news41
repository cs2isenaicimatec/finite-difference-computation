New collection of codes:  SLT/SU: Seismic Laboratory Tools (from Sugarland Texas)
This collection of codes is the work of many geophysicists, including
Zhiming Li, Rick Ottelini and others, most recently Reg Beardsley. 
Through the generosity of Chevron, these codes have been donated to 
the Colorado School of Mines and the Center for Wave Phenomena for 
general distribution in the hopes that it will prove useful to students 
and research scientists everywhere.

--------------------------
New codes include:

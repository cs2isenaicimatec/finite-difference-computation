CWP's anonymous FTP site has a new numerical IP address: 138.67.12.63.
The symbolic name is unchanged: hilbert.mines.colorado.edu

We are sorry if this causes inconvenience to anyone, but the change
was mandated by CWP's recent physical change of office location at CSM.

We now think that our recent port to SUN SparcStation was successful.
If you need to do this port, send email to john@dix.mines.colorado.edu

Recent bug fixes:
suedit  (Thx to Herve Perroud at University of Pau, France)
suxedit (ditto)
sudivcor (Thx to F. Fazzari at CWP)

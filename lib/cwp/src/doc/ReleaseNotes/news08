Several students have already inquired about the shells
I mentioned last time.  So I have made them available
for copying locally in /usr/local/cwp/src/su/examples,
even though I am actively working on them.  The ones
I regard as well along are:
Segyread, Cdpsort, Getcdps, Cos, Plotcos, Filtertest
Decontest, Cvstack, Nmoscan

Others in the works: Velan, Plotvel, Dmo, Nmostack, Mig

Dave and Ken get the credit for the geophysical ideas.
I've done a lot of hacking and am moving towards making
these examples easy to modify.

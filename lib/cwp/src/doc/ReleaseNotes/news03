SU News 02/26

Clarifications:

Recall that last time I remarked that ONLY the plotting programs
are looking for the new header keyword fields f1,d1,f2,d2.  In
particular sunmo and sumute look at the offset field and do NOT
compute offset from f2,d2.

The change of the j default in sushw can break shells.
With j=1, setting say, a=50, b=0 and c=100 produces
50,150,250,...  With j=LONG_MAX (essentially infinity), it produces
50,50,50,...  The self-doc example used b for this purpose and
now it works even if you let j default, so please give up on using
c for this purpose.

The self-doc for sushw was not, uh, clear and with some help from Ken,
may now be quasi-readable.  I am open to suggestions for making it even
better.

suspec2 had a bug that produced wrong values on the horizontal axis
in the plotting programs.  This is now fixed.  I hope.  (02/26/91)

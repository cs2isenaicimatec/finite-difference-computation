CWP Software Update: 06/04/91  (12th edition)

Based on the installation experiences at Delft and U Tulsa,
I have revised the install for the CWP free software.
I am greatly in the debt of Jan-Willem de Bruijn at the University
of Technology, Delft and Chris Liner, UTulsa for keeping a careful
list of the flaws they uncovered.  Alas, I *still* rely on the AT&T
version of make (also distributed with pure BSD's, but missing on
some BSD-clones).  Jan-Willem mentioned that the Gnu version of make
was also adequate.  (Yes, I've heard of imake; no, I'm not motivated
to learn about it.) 

The revised compressed tars available are:
	cwp.tar.Z
	plot.tar.Z
	xcwp.tar.Z
	su.tar.Z
	wx.tar.Z
Access is by anonymous ftp on: hilbert.mines.colorado.edu (or 138.67.22.6). 	
-----
"How to Use SU" is available.  Mail to jkc@keller to request
a copy of the final document.
-----
The new compressed tar for SU omits the old cplot-based
and vplot-based graphics.  Fifty percent of the install
problems were in this area, since we haven't been updating there.
With the advent of xgraph (in xcwp.tar.Z), we no longer need this
stuff.  It *is* available by special request if you want it.

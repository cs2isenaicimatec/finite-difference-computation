--------------------------
Thanks to the efforts of Balazs Nemeth and the 
Potash Corporation of Saskatoon Saskatchewan, CA. for
a new collection of codes that are being worked into
the SU package.

Thanks to Chris Liner of the University of Houston
for major contributions.

Thanks to Reg Beardsley, Nils Maercklin, Thomas Bohlen,
   Werner Heigl, Chris Robinson, Carlos Pacheco, Richard Hobbs

------------------------------------------------
Additional packages:
--------------------------
Potash_SU: This is the raw collection of materials supplied by
Balazs Nemth, with permission of Potash Corporation, Saskatoon
Saskatchewan. There is a Makefile for this collection, but some
work may be required getting the materials to install. A number of 
codes from this package have already been transferred to the main part
of SU.  Thanks to Balazs Nemeth for his work in writing these codes.
Thanks to the Potatsh Corporation for the donation of the codes
to the Colorado School of Mines.

Many of these items may be installed, but this collection will 
be a source of future codes for the main SU package.
--------------------------
BHP_SU: The link to the BHP_SU codes is reestablished. 
These codes will be mined for inclusion in the main SU package.
Thanks to BHP for the release of these codes.

This item may be installed, but will also be a source of future
codes for the main SU package.
---------------------------
SLT/SU: Seismic Laboratory Tools (from Sugarland Texas)
This collection of codes is the work of many geophysicists, including
Zhiming Li, Rick Ottelini and others, most recently Reg Beardsley. 
Through the generosity of Chevron, these codes have been donated to 
the Colorado School of Mines and the Center for Wave Phenomena for 
general distribution in the hopes that it will prove useful to students 
and research scientists everywhere.

This item may be installed, but will also be a source of future
codes for the main SU package.

--------------------------
Major change:
--------------------------

Owing to the growing number of codes in 
$CWPROOT/src/su/main

I have put in subdirectories defining what seem to be natural categories.
Over time, I expect that these category headings will be propagated
to the $CWPROOT/src/demos directory, and to Chris Liner's SU Help Page.

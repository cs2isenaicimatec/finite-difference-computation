New 3D Display Graphics:
================================================================
UNCERT (described below) now accepts data in SU format.
The module of immediate interest to the SU community is Block
which makes block diagrams of 3D data sets (including data
in SU format).  Can make rotations, bench cuts, etc.
Can produce both X windows and PostScript output.

Description:
UNCERT is a free uncertainty analysis and
geostatistical software package.  It was developed for
evaluating the inherent uncertainty in describing subsurface
geology, hydraulic properties, and the migration of
hazardous contaminants in groundwater flow systems.  The
package is well suited for evaluating hazardous waste sites
and evaluating remediation methods, but the package also
has many general modules which are usable by researchers
from a wide range of disciplines.

Limitation:
Source uses Motif Developer's package, but executable is
available for IBM and Makefiles for: SGI, SUN, SCO, HP,
and Linux.

Access:
Anonymous FTP site: gale.mines.colorado.edu (138.67.8.75)
Directories: pub/su (block for SU only) and pub/uncert (entire package)

WWW URL: http://vita.mines.colorado.edu:3857/1s/wwingle/uncert

Getting started:
A preliminary demo is located in this distribution in
demos/Block

The UNCERT manual is available from Author at cost of $25.

Note: UNCERT is in beta release
================================================================

New Header Word
================================================================
We have added the header field
	ntr - number of traces in the file
The immediate reason for adding it is that the programs in the
directory su/graphics/psplot,xplot/*.c which call the
underlying CWP graphics routines have suffered from the need
to make a temporary "file" consisting of the entire data
set (it's a memory buffer on some platforms).  When the new
ntr field is set, we can avoid making this file.  Many of
the su/graphics programs allow you to getpar the ntr value
as another convenient way to avoid making the trace file.
================================================================

New Software:
================================================================
su/main/bhedtopar -- convert a Binary tape HEaDer file to PAR
	file format.
	==> Author: John Stockwell, CWP
  
su/main/setbhed -- SET the fields in a SEGY Binary tape HEaDer
	file, as would be produced by segyread and segyhdrs
	==> Author: John Stockwell, CWP

Note: Taken together, the above two codes permit the viewing
and editing of the SEGY binary header information.

su/main/sudivstack -- diversity stacking for noise suppression
	==> Author: Mary Palen-Murphy, Colorado School of Mines

su/main/sugabor.c -- outputs a time-frequency representation
	of seismic data via the Gabor transform multifilter
	analysis technique.
	==> Author: John Stockwell, CWP
	==> Thanks to Chris Liner, U. Tulsa, for suggesting it

su/main/sureduce -- convert traces to display in reduced time,
	that is, use the offset header field to mute according
	to a specified constant velocity
	==> Author: Mike Begnaud, U. C. Davis

su/main/susynvxzcs.c -- synthetic seismograms of common shot
	gathers in v(x,z) media via Kirchhoff-style modeling
	==> Author: Zhenyue Liu, CWP

su/examples -- the shells illustrating typical processing flows
	have been translated to Bourne shell
	==> Author: Jack Cohen, CWP

par/main/smooth3d.c -- 3D grid velocity SMOOTHing by the damped
	least squares method
	==> Author: Zhenyue Liu, CWP
================================================================

New Third Party Software:
================================================================
segytoseres.c -- convert segy input to seres ascii output
	==> Author: Stew Levin, Mobil

Versatec plotting support is available by anonymous ftp from
	geophy.univ-pau.fr in the pub/versa directory.
	==> Thanks to Dominique Rousset, France
	    rousset@iprrs3.univ-pau.fr
================================================================

New Directory
================================================================
cwputils/lib -- contains the timing routines walltime,
wallsec, cputime, cpusec formerly in cwp/lib.  These routines
caused portability problems all out of proportion to their
value and hence we've isolated them to an optionally compiled
directory. See Portability/README_CWPUTILS for more information.
================================================================

	==> Thanks to Jim Schatzman, U Wyoming
================================================================

Unresolved Issues
================================================================
-We've had requests for a program to set geometry in the SU
headers.  We need to know the format used in recording this
information in the field.  Can anyone help us?

-psplot/main/pscube.c - can't specify subset of cube. Work around
is to window the data with suwind to the desired subset before
piping to pscube.  Thanks to Bob Szerbiak for alerting us.

-su/main/suresstat.c
Bob Harms of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation
reports various difficulties with this code (written by a
committee of undergraduates) that we haven't examined yet.

-su/main/suresamp.c
Toralf Foerster suggested several useful improvements not yet
put in the distribution.

-Support for the alternate data formats in SEG-Y
Remco Romyn of Delft University of Technology and others
have suggested support for other formats such as
(2 bytes fixed point).  The bit manipulations needed
to convert such data to IEEE are not known to us.

-Ability to manipulate headers with no data field
Stew Levin of Mobil has suggested this.

-Improvements for su/include trace header handing
Donated by Stew Levin of Mobil, still under study here.

SU News

First: if you want OFF this mailing list, just let me know by e-mail.
       likewise let me know if you think someone else would like to get this.
Second: I will try to be real brief--e-mail if you want example usages, etc.

Problem: programs like suspec1, suspec2 output data that is not in time
	domain and because the dimensions are set in part by the
	(unknown to the user) fft algorithm, the plotting programs
	can't compute the right numerical labels.

Solution: I added some new header words so that plotting programs like
	suximage can look in the header to see d1,f1,d2,f2.

Note that users have no good way to set d1,f1,d2,f2--for now
this is the province of programs like suspec1.

Affected programs:
suspec1, suspec2, sufft
suximage, suxwigb, supsimage, supswigb, supswigp
and indirectly ALL the su mains because segy.h, header.h, hdr.h are changed.

Beta site!  Chris Liner, a key author of SU, has the new version
	running at U Tulsa and will use it in his classes there.

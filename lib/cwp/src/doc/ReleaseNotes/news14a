Sorry to report this, but for a few weeks around Nov 11, until now, the
advertised new cwp distribution was not healthy.
The easiest symptom to spot is that
the directory Xcwp was missing from plot.tar.

I think we are OK now.

For those with Suns, order the new ANSI C compiler from them and
stay tuned.  We will be attempting an install on a Sparc owned by
Tom Pratt next door at USGS.  Our first attempt went pretty well, but
we ran into a problem with the location of the system X Windows include files.

Also, if you don't have Motif, you will have to comment out the call to that
include in .../Xcwp/include/Xcwp.h and fence off fftlab.c in
.../Xcwp/main/Makefile.  At least I hope that's all--we'll find out when we
next attempt the Sun port.

CWP Software Update: 12/16/92  (18th edition)

The anonymous ftp directories have been updated.  The new install process
requires setting an environmental variable.  The good news is that the
Install is much quicker with this approach.

ALERT:  A small, but pervasive, change has been made in the self-doc
facility.  You will not be able to compile the now updated par,
graphics and su codes without first updating your par/lib directory
by including the subroutines in docpkge.c and re-making the library.
(Of course, this is done automatically if you re-install with the new tars.)
John Stockwell gets applause for running around the system and
updating all the mains.

The reason for changing the self-doc set up is that long self-docs
can overflow the compiler string buffer and thus prevent compilation.
Actually, this used to happen a lot more than it does now.  But it
still happens occasionally and the size of the buffer is
vendor-dependent, so we cannot use our local experience as a reliable
guide.  The idea (suggested by Dave Hale) is that instead of making
the self-doc one humongous string, we now make it an array of one
line strings.  Users will see no difference.  Programmers can just
clone a self-doc from a new-style program and replace the call to
"askdoc" by one to "requestdoc".

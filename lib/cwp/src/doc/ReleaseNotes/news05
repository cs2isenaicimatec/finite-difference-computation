The continuing saga ...
	plotters default d1,f1,d2,f2 behavior changed again.
	Affected programs are:
	suximage,suxwigb, psimage, pswigb, pswigp (03/05/91)

Let me know if more problems arise.  Remember that getpar always
wins, so you can over-come the defaults with things like
	suximage d2=8.333 ...

Also, we have a new program that may help:
segyclean--zero portion of unassigned area in headers that SU uses. (03/03/91)

suband tweaked (03/03/91)

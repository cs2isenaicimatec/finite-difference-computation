CWP Software Update: 05/04/91  (11th edition)

"How to Use SU" is being written.  See Jack Cohen or John Stockwell
if you want to see a draft copy.  Mail to jkc@keller to request
a copy of the final document.

New Programs:
a2b - convert n columns of ascii floats to binary floats
b2a - convert binary floats to ascii file with n columns
mkparfile - convert 2 columns of ascii floats to the parameter
	vector form needed by CWP programs

     The first two programs are intended to be of general use; the
last one is obviously special purpose and replaces "vel2conv" which
has been circulating in the underground and was even MORE special.

     The first and third are used in the .../su/examples shells such
as the latest versions of Firstbreak (new shell!), Velan and Velan.nmo.

Bugs in the Tar Distribution Files:
I *think* I fixed a bug in the su tar distribution that caused the su
files to appear one level too high when extracted from the tar file.
I've also noticed that the latest version prints a lot of spurious
"Already Installed" error messages (sigh).

CWP Software Update: 09/16/92  (17th edition)

New tars of the CWP free software were put up yesterday,
so it's good time to list the changes in CWP's software over the past
few months.

Special note: There will be a team of 3 CSM seniors (Computer Scientist,
Mathematician, Geophysicist) doing a project centered around SU. If you
have some ideas for them, please pass them along.

Changed programs:
segyhdrs (John: set any binary tape header field)
segyread, segywrite (Jack: call new su/lib/conv_float)
suband (GONE: obsoleted by sufilter)
suedit, suxedit (Jack: moved some stuff to valpkge)
sufrac (Jack: loop limit error and some tweaks)
sumute (John: use arbitrary keyword instead of just offset)
suwind (Jack: minor fixes)
supsgraph, suxgraph (Jack: fix to handle non-time domain data)
su/lib/valpkge (Jack: some stuff from suwind moved here)
su/lib/conv_float (Thanks to Stew Levin/Mobil, Brian Sumner/Texaco)
sukeyword (John: takes PAGER fron users's environment)
cwp/lib/rfwtva (Craig: dead trace bug in pswigb, etc.)
Xcwp/lib/Axes.c (Craig: increase portability)
xwigb,ximage (Craig: polarity bug)
xgraph (Craig: increased functionality)

New programs:
sufilter (John): takes user-supplied filter; replaces suband)
sutvband (Jack): adaptive band pass filtering 
sugendocs (John): generates the SU self-docs as a LaTeX document-92 pages!)
recast (John): transform data from one type (eg. float) to another (eg. double)

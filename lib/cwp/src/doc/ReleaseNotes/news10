CWP Software Update: 04/24/91  (10th edition)
SU News 04/24/91

The major news this time is not about SU, but rather the underlying
CWP graphics:

Dave Hale got out the ToolKit manuals and xgraph now responds to the
window manager.  It also zooms on button1 in the same way as the
other CWP graphics.  The X functionality on button2 and keyboard
input is not the same as for ximage and xwigb.  On the other hand,
xgraph admits the use of X Resource files, etc.  Eventually, we
expect all the CWP X graphics to look more like xgraph, so we've
decided that this is a good time to export it--see below.

Hengren Xia, visiting scientist next door in CPFS, has given us
some good suggestions for improving the X picking functionality
(eg. picking velocities, first breaks, etc. from an suximage).
We'll think about that too!

New ftp file: xcwp.tar.Z resides in ftp/pub and contains the
	source for xgraph (see above) and Dave's Discrete
	Fourier Transform teaching tool, fftlab.  The latter
	is Motif dependent, the former uses only the ToolKit.

SU:
The example shells are in /usr/local/cwp/src/su/examples for
local users and are now available by "anonymous ftp" as pub/suex.tar.Z
for remote users.  This is a temporary compressed tar for those who
already have the rest of SU.  The new version of pub/su.tar.Z DOES
contain these shells.  I suggest starting with the Dmo shell as a nice
simple example. I hope that these example processing shells will provide
an introduction to the use of SU.

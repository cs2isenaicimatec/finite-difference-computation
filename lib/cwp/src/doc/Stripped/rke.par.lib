Abstract:
Means of estimating the truncation error of Runge-Kutta type methods are 
considered. A number of existing processes have various disadvantages, 
giving a valid estimate only for certain types of equation. The conditions 
are stated for a process to give a valid estimate when applied to a general 
system of differential equations, and a number of fifth order estimates 
are proposed for a fourth order Runge-Kutta type method. Some numerical tests 
are applied to these processes, which suggest their superiority over 
Merson's process.

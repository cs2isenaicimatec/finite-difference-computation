PSWIGGLE - draw wiggle-trace with (optional) area-fill via PostScript

psWiggle  draw wiggle-trace with (optional) area-fill via PostScript

Function Prototype:
void psWiggle (int n, float z[], float zmin, float zmax, float zbase,
	float yzmin, float yzmax, float xfirst, float xlast, int fill);

Inputs:
n		number of samples to draw
z		array to draw
zmin		z values below zmin will be clipped
zmax		z values above zmax will be clipped
zbase		z values between zbase and either zmin or zmax will be filled
yzmin		y-coordinate corresponding to zmin
yzmax		y-coordinate corresponding to zmax
xfirst		x-coordinate corresponding to z[0]
xlast		x-coordinate corresponding to z[n-1]
fill		= 0 for no fill
			  > 0 for fill between zbase and zmax
			  < 0 for fill between zbase and zmin
		+2 for fill solid between zbase and zmax grey between zbase and zmin
		-2 for fill solid between zbase and zmin grey between zbase and zmax
		SHADING: 2<= abs(fill) <=5   abs(fill)=2 light grey  abs(fill)=5 black

NOTES:
psWiggle reduces PostScript output by eliminating linetos when
z values are essentially constant.  The tolerance for detecting 
constant" z values is ZEPS*(zmax-zmin), where ZEPS is a fraction 
defined below.

A more complete optimization would eliminate all connected line 
segments that are essentially colinear.

psWiggle breaks up the wiggle into segments that can be drawn
without exceeding the PostScript pathlimit.

           Corrected dead trace bug.  Now the last point of each segment
           is guaranteed to be drawn.

           added fill=+/-2 option of solid/grey color scheme

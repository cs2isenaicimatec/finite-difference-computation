INTTABLE8 -  Interpolation of a uniformly-sampled complex function y(x)
		via a table of 8-coefficient interpolators

intt8c	interpolation of a uniformly-sampled complex function y(x)
		via a table of 8-coefficient interpolators
intt8r	interpolation of a uniformly-sampled real function y(x) via a
		table of 8-coefficient interpolators

Function Prototype:
void intt8c (int ntable, float table[][8],
	int nxin, float dxin, float fxin, complex yin[], 
	complex yinl, complex yinr, int nxout, float xout[], complex yout[]);
void intt8r (int ntable, float table[][8],
	int nxin, float dxin, float fxin, float yin[], 
	float yinl, float yinr, int nxout, float xout[], float yout[]);

Input:
ntable		number of tabulated interpolation operators; ntable>=2
table		array of tabulated 8-point interpolation operators
nxin		number of x values at which y(x) is input
dxin		x sampling interval for input y(x)
fxin		x value of first sample input
yin		array of input y(x) values:  yin[0] = y(fxin), etc.
yinl		value used to extrapolate yin values to left of yin[0]
yinr		value used to extrapolate yin values to right of yin[nxin-1]
nxout		number of x values a which y(x) is output
xout		array of x values at which y(x) is output

Output:
yout		array of output y(x) values:  yout[0] = y(xout[0]), etc.

NOTES:
ntable must not be less than 2.

The table of interpolation operators must be as follows:

Let d be the distance, expressed as a fraction of dxin, from a particular
xout value to the sampled location xin just to the left of xout.  Then,
for d = 0.0,

table[0][0:7] = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0

are the weights applied to the 8 input samples nearest xout.
Likewise, for d = 1.0,

table[ntable-1][0:7] = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0

are the weights applied to the 8 input samples nearest xout.  In general,
for d = (float)itable/(float)(ntable-1), table[itable][0:7] are the
weights applied to the 8 input samples nearest xout.  If the actual sample
distance d does not exactly equal one of the values for which interpolators
are tabulated, then the interpolator corresponding to the nearest value of
d is used.

Because extrapolation of the input function y(x) is defined by the left
and right values yinl and yinr, the xout values are not restricted to lie
within the range of sample locations defined by nxin, dxin, and fxin.

WAVEFORMS   Subroutines to define some wavelets for modeling of seismic
            data
    
ricker1_wavelet     Compute the time response of a source function as
            a Ricker wavelet with peak frequency "fpeak" Hz.    

ricker2_wavelet     Compute a Ricke wavelet with a given period, amplitude
            and distorsion factor

akb_wavelet         Compute the time response of a source function as
            a wavelet based on a wavelet used by Alford, Kelly, 
            and Boore.

spike_wavelet       Compute the time response of a source function as
            a spike.    

unit_wavelet        Compute the time response of a source function as
            a constant unit shift.  

zero_wavelet        Compute the time response of a source function as
            zero everywhere.    

berlage_wavelet     Compute the time response of a source function as a
            Berlage wavelet with peak frequency "fpeak" Hz, 
            exponential decay factor "decay", time exponent 
            "tn", and initial phase angle "ipa".

gaussian_wavelet    Compute the time response of a source function as a
            Gaussian wavelet with peak frequency "fpeak" in Hz.

gaussderiv_wavelet  Compute the time response of a source function as a
            Gaussian first derivative wavelet with peak frequency "fpeak" 
            in Hz.
deriv_n_gauss  Compute the n-th derivative of a gaussian in double precision

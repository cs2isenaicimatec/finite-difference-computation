FRANUNI - Functions to generate a pseudo-random float uniformly distributed
	on [0,1); i.e., between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive)

franuni		return a random float
sranuni		seed random number generator

Function Prototypes:
float franuni (void);
void sranuni (int seed);

franuni:
Input:		(none)
Returned:	pseudo-random float

sranuni:
seed		different seeds yield different sequences of random numbers.

Notes:
Adapted from subroutine uni in Kahaner, Moler, and Nash (1988). 
This book references a set of unpublished notes by
Marsaglia.

According to the reference, this random
number generator "passes all known tests and has a period that is ...
approximately 10^19".

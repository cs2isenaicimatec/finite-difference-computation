WPCBUFFAL - routines to allocate/initialize and free buffers

buffAlloc1 - allocate a 1D  buffer of size n and initialize
buffRealloc1 - reallocate a 1D buffer of size to n and set the 
		position to end of buffer if n is less than buff->pos 
buffFree1 -  free a 1D buffer
buffAlloc2 - allocate an array[n1] of buffers each with size n2 and
		initialize
buffFree2 -  free a 2D buffer

Function Prototypes:
void *buffAlloc1(int n)
void buffRealloc1(void *inbuff, int n)
void buffFree1(void *inbuff)
void **buffAlloc2(int n1, int n2)
void buffFree2(void **inbuff, int n1)

buffAlloc1:
Input:
n		size of buffer
Return:
pointer to (void *)

buffRealloc1:
Input:
inbuff		buffer to be reallocated
n		new size

buffFree1:
Input:
inbuff		buffer to be freed

buffAlloc2:
n1		number of buffers in the array
n2		size of each buffer

buffFree2:
inbuff		buffer array to be freed
n1		number of buffers to be freed

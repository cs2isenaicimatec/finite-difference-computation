LPRED - Lateral Prediction of Several Plane Waves

lpred - lateral prediction of several plane waves

Function Prototype:
void lpred(float **f, int n1, int n2, int lblock, int hlfilter, int nslope,
	   lpFilter *lpf, float **res);

Input:
f        array[][] of signal
n1       length of the signal along the 1st dimension
n2       length of the signal along the 2nd dimension
lblock   length of each block
hlfilter half-length of the filter
nslope   number of plane waves predicted
lpf      lateral prediction filter
res      residual of prediction

WAVETRANS2 - 2D wavelet transform by tensor-product of two 1D transforms

Function Prototype:
int waveTrans_2(float **x, float **y, waveFilter *filter, 
	int twopow1, int twopow2, int stage1, int stage2, int type);

Input:
x	array[][] for the signal
y 	array[][] for the wavelet coefficients
filter	wavelet filter structure
twopow1	2^pow1 is the length of the signal along 1st dimension
twopow2	2^pow2 is the length of the signal along 2nd dimension
stage1   stage of decomposition along 1st dimension 
stage2   stage of decomposition along 2nd dimension 
type	0 for decomposition, 1 for reconstruction

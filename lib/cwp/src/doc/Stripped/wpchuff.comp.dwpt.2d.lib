WPCHUFF -Routines for in memory Huffman coding/decoding

huffCompress - huffman compress a byte stream in a memory buffer and output 
		the bit stream into another memory buffer
huffDecompress - decompress a huffman coded bit stream in a memory buffer and 
		output the byte stream into another memory buffer   

Function Prototypes:
int huffCompress(void *inb, void *outb)
int huffDecompress(void *inb, void *outb)

huffCompress:
Input:
inb	buffer holding the input byte stream 
Output:
outb	buffer holding the output bit stream

huffDecompres:
inb	buffer holding the input bit stream 
outb	buffer holding the output byte stream

Note:
The algorithm is based on that in Mark Nelson's "Data 
Compression" book. The compression is performed in memory here.

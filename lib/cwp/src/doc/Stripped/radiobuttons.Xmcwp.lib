XtcwpCreateStringRadioButtons		create an XmFrame containing radio
						buttons labeled with strings

Function Prototypes:
Widget XtcwpCreateStringRadioButtons (Widget parent, char *label,
	int nstrings, char **strings, int first,
	void (*callback)(int selected, void *clientdata), void *clientdata);

Input:
parent		parent widget

nstrings	number of strings
strings		array[nstrings] of character strings, one per button

PSCONTOUR - draw contour of a two-dimensional array via PostScript

psContour	draw contour of a two-dimensional array via PostScript

Function Prototype:
void psContour (float c, int nx, float x[], int ny, float y[], float z[],
	float lcs, char *lcf, char *lcc, float *w, int nplaces);

Input:
c			contour value
nx			number of x-coordinates
x			array of x-coordinates (see notes below)
ny			number of y-coordinates
y			array of y-coordinates (see notes below)
lcs			font size of contour label
lcf			font name of contour label
lcc			color of contour label
LSB flag arrays (see Notes):
z			array of nx*ny z(x,y) values (see notes below)
w			array of nx*ny z(x,y) values (see notes below)

Notes:
The two-dimensional array z is actually passed as a one-dimensional
array containing nx*ny values, stored with nx fast and ny slow.

The x and y arrays define a grid that is not necessarily 
uniformly-sampled.  Linear interpolation of z values on the 
grid defined by the x and y arrays is used to determine z values 
between the gridpoints.
		 
The two least significant bits of z are used to mark intersections
of the contour with the x,y grid; therefore, the z values will
almost always be altered (slightly) by contour.

pscontour isolates the use of PostScript to four internal functions:

void coninit(void) - called before any contour drawing
void conmove(float x, float y) - moves current position to x,y
void condraw(float x, float y) - draws from current position to x,y
void condone(void) - called when contour drawing is done

These functions can usually be replaced with equivalent functions in
other graphics environments.

The w array is used to restrict the range of contour labeling that 
occurs only if w<1. 

As suggested in the reference, the following scheme is used to refer
to a cell of the two-dimensional array z:

                north (0)
      (ix,iy+1)	--------- (ix+1,iy+1)
                | cell  |
       west (3)	| ix,iy	| east (1)
                |       |
        (ix,iy) --------- (ix+1,iy)
                south (2)

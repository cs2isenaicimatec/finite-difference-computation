HILBERT - Compute Hilbert transform y of x

hilbert		compute the Hilbert transform

Function Prototype:
void hilbert (int n, float x[], float y[]);

Input:
n		length of x and y
x		array[n] to be Hilbert transformed

Output:
y		array[n] containing Hilbert transform of x

Notes:
The Hilbert transform is computed by convolving x with a
windowed (approximate) version of the ideal Hilbert transformer.

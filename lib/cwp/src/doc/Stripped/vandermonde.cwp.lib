VANDERMONDE - Functions to solve Vandermonde system of equations Vx=b 

vanded		solve Vandermonde system of doubles
vandef		solve Vandermonde system of floats

Function Prototypes:
void vanded (int n, double v[], double b[], double x[]);
void vandef (int n, float v[], float b[], float x[]);

Input:
n		dimension of system
v		array[n] of 2nd row of Vandermonde matrix (1st row is all ones)
b		array[n] of right-hand-side column vector

Output:
x		array[n] of solution column vector

Notes:
The arrays b and x may be equivalenced.

oppenheim_unwrap_phase - using the method of Oppenheim and Schafer (1975)
simple_unwrap_phase - by searching for phase jumps


Function Prototype:

		float df, float *xr, float *xi, float *phase);
void simple_unwrap_phase(int n, int trend, int zeromean, 
		float w,  float *phase);
oppenheim_unwrap_phase:
Input:
n		number of samples
df		frequency sampling interval
trend		remove linear trend from unwrapped phase
xr		real part of signal
xi		imaginary part of signal

Output:
phase		array[n] of output unwrapped phase values

simple_unwrap_phase:
Input:
n               number of samples
trend           remove linear trend from phase
zeromean        =0 assume phase(0)=0.0, else assume zero mean
w               unwrapping parameter; returns an error if w=0
phase           array[n] of inpu

Output:
phase           array[n] of output phase values

Notes:
1) The phase unwrapping method proposed by Oppenheim and Schaffer 
   1975 calculates the unwrapped phase by integrating the derivative 
   with respect to frequency of the phase of a signal F(w) . 

   Let u(w) = Re F(w) and v(w) = Im F(w)

   phase(w) = arctan[v(w)/u(w)] 

   Taking the derivative with respect to w of both sides

d/dw [ phase(w) ] = d/dw ( arctan (v/u) )
=   [ 1/ (1 +(v/u)^2) ] ( v'/u - vu'/u^2 ) = ( v'u - vu' )/(u^2 +v^2) 

2) Then, the d/dw phase   is integrated with respect to w 
   to produce the phase function

   phase(w) = integral phase'(w)  dw

3) the user has the option of removing the linear trend in the phase

   The approach allows us to avoid the principle branch behavior of
   the arctangent function.

Notes:
The strategy is to look at the change in phase (dphase) with each
time step. If |dphase| >  PI/w, then use the previous value of
dphase. No attempt is made at smoothing the dphase curve.

STOEP - Functions to solve a symmetric Toeplitz linear system of equations
	 Rf=g for f

stoepd		solve a symmetric Toeplitz system - doubles
stoepf		solve a symmetric Toeplitz system - floats

Function Prototypes:
void stoepd (int n, double r[], double g[], double f[], double a[]);
void stoepf (int n, float r[], float g[], float f[], float a[]);

Input:
n		dimension of system
r		array[n] of top row of Toeplitz matrix
g		array[n] of right-hand-side column vector

Output:
f		array[n] of solution (left-hand-side) column vector
a		array[n] of solution to Ra=v (Claerbout, FGDP, p. 57)

Notes:
These routines do NOT solve the case when the main diagonal is zero, it
just silently returns.

The left column of the Toeplitz matrix is assumed to be equal to the top
row (as specified in r); i.e., the Toeplitz matrix is assumed symmetric.

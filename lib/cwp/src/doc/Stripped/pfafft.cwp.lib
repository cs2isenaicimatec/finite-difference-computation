Notes:
Table of valid n and cost for prime factor fft.  For each n, cost
was estimated to be the inverse of the number of ffts done in 1 sec
on an IBM RISC System/6000 Model 320H, by Dave Hale, 08/04/91.
(Redone by Jack Cohen for 15 sec to rebuild NTAB table on advice of
David and Gregory Chudnovsky, 05/03/94).
Cost estimates are least accurate for very small n.  An alternative method
for estimating cost would be to count multiplies and adds, but this
method fails to account for the overlapping of multiplies and adds
that is possible on some computers, such as the IBM RS/6000 family.

npfa:
The returned n will be composed of mutually prime factors from
the set {2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13,16}.  Because n cannot exceed
720720 = 5*7*9*11*13*16, 720720 is returned if nmin exceeds 720720.

npfao:
The returned n will be composed of mutually prime factors from
the set {2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13,16}.  Because n cannot exceed
720720 = 5*7*9*11*13*16, 720720 is returned if nmin exceeds 720720.
If nmin does not exceed 720720, then the returned n will not be 
less than nmin.  The optimal n is chosen to minimize the estimated
cost of performing the fft, while satisfying the constraint, if
possible, that n not exceed nmax.

npfar and npfaro:
Current implemenations of real-to-complex and complex-to-real prime 
factor ffts require that the transform length n be even and that n/2 
be a valid length for a complex-to-complex prime factor fft.  The 
value returned by npfar satisfies these conditions.  Also, see notes 
for npfa.

pfacc:
n must be factorable into mutually prime factors taken 
from the set {2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13,16}.  in other words,
	n = 2**p * 3**q * 5**r * 7**s * 11**t * 13**u
where
	0 <= p <= 4,  0 <= q <= 2,  0 <= r,s,t,u <= 1
is required for pfa to yield meaningful results.  this
restriction implies that n is restricted to the range
	1 <= n <= 720720 (= 5*7*9*11*13*16)

pfacr:
Because pfacr uses pfacc to do most of the work, n must be even 
and n/2 must be a valid length for pfacc.  The simplest way to
obtain a valid n is via n = npfar(nmin).  A more optimal n can be 
obtained with npfaro.

pfarc:
Because pfarc uses pfacc to do most of the work, n must be even 
and n/2 must be a valid length for pfacc.  The simplest way to
obtain a valid n is via n = npfar(nmin).  A more optimal n can be 
obtained with npfaro.

pfamcc:
To perform a two-dimensional transform of an n1 by n2 complex array 
(assuming that both n1 and n2 are valid "n"), stored with n1 fast 
and n2 slow:
    pfamcc(isign,n1,n2,1,n1,z); (to transform 1st dimension)
    pfamcc(isign,n2,n1,n1,1,z); (to transform 2nd dimension)

pfa2cc:
Only one (either the 1st or 2nd) dimension of the 2-D array is transformed.

If idim equals 1, then n2 transforms of n1 complex elements are performed; 
else, if idim equals 2, then n1 transforms of n2 complex elements are 
performed.

Although z appears in the argument list as a one-dimensional array,
z may be viewed as an n1 by n2 two-dimensional array:  z[n2][n1].

Valid n is computed via the "np" subroutines.

To perform a two-dimensional transform of an n1 by n2 complex array 
(assuming that both n1 and n2 are valid "n"), stored with n1 fast 
and n2 slow:  pfa2cc(isign,1,n1,n2,z);  pfa2cc(isign,2,n1,n2,z);

pfa2cr:
If idim equals 1, then n2 transforms of n1/2+1 complex elements to n1 real 
elements are performed; else, if idim equals 2, then n1 transforms of n2/2+1 
complex elements to n2 real elements are performed.

Although rz appears in the argument list as a one-dimensional array,
rz may be viewed as an n1 by n2 two-dimensional array:  rz[n2][n1].  
Likewise, depending on idim, cz may be viewed as either an n1/2+1 by 
n2 or an n1 by n2/2+1 two-dimensional array of complex elements.

Let n denote the transform length, either n1 or n2, depending on idim.
Because pfa2rc uses pfa2cc to do most of the work, n must be even 
and n/2 must be a valid length for pfa2cc.  The simplest way to
obtain a valid n is via n = npfar(nmin).  A more optimal n can be 
obtained with npfaro.

pfa2rc:
If idim equals 1, then n2 transforms of n1 real elements to n1/2+1 complex 
elements are performed; else, if idim equals 2, then n1 transforms of n2 
real elements to n2/2+1 complex elements are performed.

Although rz appears in the argument list as a one-dimensional array,
rz may be viewed as an n1 by n2 two-dimensional array:  rz[n2][n1].  
Likewise, depending on idim, cz may be viewed as either an n1/2+1 by 
n2 or an n1 by n2/2+1 two-dimensional array of complex elements.

Let n denote the transform length, either n1 or n2, depending on idim.
Because pfa2rc uses pfa2cc to do most of the work, n must be even 
and n/2 must be a valid length for pfa2cc.  The simplest way to
obtain a valid n is via n = npfar(nmin).  A more optimal n can be 
obtained with npfaro.

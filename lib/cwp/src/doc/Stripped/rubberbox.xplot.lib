RUBBERBOX -  Function to draw a rubberband box in X-windows plots

xRubberBox	Track pointer with rubberband box

Function Prototype:
void xRubberBox (Display *dpy, Window win, XEvent event,
	int *x, int *y, int *width, int *height);

Input:
dpy		display pointer
win		window ID
event		event of type ButtonPress

Output:
x		x of upper left hand corner of box in pixels
y		y of upper left hand corner of box in pixels
width		width of box in pixels
height		height of box in pixels

Notes:
xRubberBox assumes that event is a ButtonPress event for the 1st button;
i.e., it tracks motion of the pointer while the 1st button is down, and
it sets x, y, w, and h and returns after a ButtonRelease event for the
1st button.

Before calling xRubberBox, both ButtonRelease and Button1Motion events 
must be enabled.

This is the same rubberbox.c as in Xtcwp/lib, only difference is
that xRubberBox here is XtcwpRubberBox there, and a shift has been
added to make the rubberbox more visible.

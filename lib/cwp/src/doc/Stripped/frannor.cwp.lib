FRANNOR - functions to generate a pseudo-random float normally distributed
		with N(0,1); i.e., with zero mean and unit variance.

frannor		return a normally distributed random float
srannor		seed random number generator for normal distribution

Function Prototypes:
float frannor (void);
void srannor (int seed);

frannor:
Input:		(none)
Returned:	normally distributed random float

srannor:
Input:
seed		different seeds yield different sequences of random numbers.

which in turn was based on  an algorithm by 
Marsaglia and Tsang (1984).

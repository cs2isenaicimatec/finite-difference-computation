PRINTERPLOT - Functions to make a printer plot of a 1-dimensional array

pp1d		printer plot of 1d array 
pplot1		printer plot of 1d array 

Function Prototypes:
void pp1d (FILE *fp, char *title, int lx, int ifx, float x[]);
void pplot1 (FILE *fp, char *title, int nx, float ax[]);

pp1d:
Input:
fp		file pointer for output (e.g., stdout, stderr, etc.)
title		title of plot
lx		length of x
ifx		index of first x
x		array[lx] to be plotted

pplot1:
Input:
fp		file pointer for printed output (e.g., stdout, stderr, etc.)
title		title of plot
nx		number of x values to be plotted
ax		array[nx] of x values

Notes:
Are two subroutines to do this really necessary?

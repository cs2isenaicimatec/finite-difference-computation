DELETE - DELETE vertex, model, edge, or boundary edge from triangulated model

deleteVertexFromModel		Delete a vertex from model
killModel			Delete a model along with everything in it
killEdge			Delete an edge
killBoundaryEdge		Kill a boundary edge

Function Prototypes:
void deleteVertexFromModel (Model *m, Vertex *v);
void killModel (Model *m);
void killEdge (Edge *e, Face **fs);
void killBoundaryEdge (Edge *e);

deleteVertexFromModel:
Input:
m	 	pointer to Model	
v		pointer to Vertex to be deleted

killModel:
Input:
m		pointer to Model

killEdge:
Input:
e		Edge to delete

Output:
fs		surviving Face

killBoundaryEdge:
Input:
e 	boundary Edge

Notes:
Killing a boundary edge is typically done after a new boundary vertex
is inserted on an existing boundary edge.

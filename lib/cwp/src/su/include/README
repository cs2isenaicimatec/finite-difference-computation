The include files header.h and hdr.h are made or updated automatically
by issuing a "make" command in this directory.  An update is required
when fields are added or deleted from segy.h.  The makefile relies on
the phrases "long tracl" and "unass" remaining in segy.h as it was
delivered.

The include files su.h and suport.h are also maintained here.

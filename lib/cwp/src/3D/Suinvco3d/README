SUINVCO3D - Lan Wang's Kirchhoff-WKBJ common offset Inversion for
v(x,y,z) background velocity models. The WKBJ parameters are computed
via dynamic raytracing.

This code depends on the libraries  libcwp.a and libpar.a
that are part of the CWP Free software package
that is distributed freely by the Center for Wave Phenomena.
These codes may be obtained via anonymous ftp from
hilbert.Mines.EDU (138.67.12.63).
The critical directory path is pub/cwpcodes
and the files are:

untar_me_first.xx.tar.Z  
cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z
documentation.all.xx.tar.Z

where xx is the number of the current release.

A Makefile has been provided to compile SUINVCO3D.
If you have installed the CWP/SU free software package and have
the CWPROOT path set appropriately, then you may compile
this code by simply typing  

% make

Once the code is compiled, type the name of the program on the command
line to see its self-documentation.

Demos are provided in the directory ./Demo

README for SUINVCO3D				4 October 2000

This demo depends on the CWP free software package
and the SU (seismic UNIX) package.


The program SUINVCO3D implements Kirchhoff-WKBJ
3D Inversion (true amplitude migration) on
a test data set created using CSHOT. The
exact background velocity profile is used for
the inversion in this demo. The input datatype
for SUINVCO3D is in the su-form.

To run the demo, type:

Unif2       to create the velocity profile
CShot       to create synthetic data
Table	    to generate the traveltime, amplitude and Beylkin determinant	
Suinvco3d   to invert the synthetic data
Xplot       view the velocity, synthetic data and inversion (X-windows output)
PSplot      view the velocity, synthetic data and inversion (PostScript output)

Note:  SUINVCO3D requires a smooth velocity.

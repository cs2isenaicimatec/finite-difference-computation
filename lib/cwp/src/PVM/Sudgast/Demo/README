The shells in this directory form a complete demo for sudgast. 
The following is a short description of each one the shells:

CreateData: 	Creates a synthetic data set for testing the sudgast code. 
		Noise and fake statics are added via suaddnoise and 
		suaddstatics respectivelly. This shell plots one 
		of the shot gathers (without noise and statics) using suxwigb.

DemoDga:	Creates crosscorrelation table with sustxcor and runs sudgast. 
		Remember that the executable files for sudgast (namely 
		sudgast and process) HAVE to reside in the ~/pvm/DIR directory.
		DIR depends on the machine you are working on. Please see
		the README file in the dga directory for a list of values
		which DIR can have. This shell will execute the command 
                pvmd host & that will start pvm. host is a file with the 
                name of the machine that you are going to run sudgast on.

Apply:		Runs sustapply for applying the statics computed for the 
		synthetic data set generated in CreateData and plots (using
		suxwigb) the final stacked data. 

Clean:		Remove all the files created in previous demos.

Simply type the name of the shell script to execute the demo.

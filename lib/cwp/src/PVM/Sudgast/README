Sudgast   CWP Proprietary Software       U-30

Proprietary to the Consortium Project on Inversion of Complex Structure
until  5 Jan 1997.

This is the software package sudgast. Sudgast stands for Seismic Unix 
Distributed Genetic Algorithm Statics estimation. To use this code you 
should have installed a recent version of the CWP/SU Free Software
package and PVM v2.4 (Parallel Virtual Machine). 

All the source files that form the library libdga.a are in the directory
sudagst/lib. Typing make will build this library. In the directory main
you will find the following source codes:

sudgast.c:	Main program for sudgast (the master program)
process.c:	The slave program
sustapply.c:	Apply statics provided by sudgast on the data
sustxcor.c:	Builds crosscorrelation table for the stacking procedure
suaddstatics.c:	Add random, surface consistent statics on seismic data
		sets

Go to the directory main and type make to compile all those codes. 


IMPORTANT !
PVM REQUIRES that the executable codes for sudgast.c and process.c be
installed in the directory ~/pvm/DIR, where DIR depends on the machine
you are working on. DIR can be set to the following values: 

      DIR       Machine
    --------    -------
    AFX8        Alliant FX/8
    BFLY        BBN Butterfly TC2000
    C2MP        Convex
    CM2         Thinking Machines CM-2
    CRAY        Cray
    HP9K        HP 9000 (Snake)
    I860        Intel RX Hypercube
    IPSC        Intel IPSC/2
    NEXT        NeXT
    PMAX        Dec/Mips arch (3100, 5000, etc.)
    RIOS        IBM/RS6000
    SGI         Silicon Graphics IRIS
    SUN3        Sun 3
    SUN4        Sun 4, 4c, sparc, etc.
    SYMM        Sequent Symmetry
    TITN        Stardent Titan
    UVAX        Dec/Microvax

You SHOULD create this directory before attempting to install sudgast.

You will also need to change the line in main/Makefile
that reads:

B = $(HOME)/pvm/RIOS

to the appropriate path for your system.


Among all the programs listed above only sudgast.c and process.c use the 
PVM library, so only those should have their respective executable files
in ~/pvm/DIR. However, as a (possible) convenience for the user all executable
files (sudgast, process, sustxcor, sustapply and suaddstatics) are
installed in this directory.

The following is a step by step list that you should follow in order to 
install sudgast.

1) Install a current release of the CWP/SU Free software package
2) Install PVM v2.4
3) Create the directory ~/pvm/DIR  (edit main/Makefile accordingly)
4) From the current directory type cd lib and then make
5) From the current directory type cd main and then make
6) run sudgast, sustxcor, sustapply and suaddstatics for standard CWP
   selfdoc documentation

To run the sudgast demo go from the current directory to the Demo 
directory and read the README file there.

README for CWPROOT/Complex

This directory contains a library and an example C++ code that
shows how to interface C++ programs with libcwp.a. It should
also be possible to interface C++ programs with libpar.a and libsu.a,
as well.

The materials here are still experimental and is guaranteed to compile only
with  GNU's  g++  compiler. It has not been tested with any other
C++ compiler. 

The library libComplex.a contains C++ routines that permit the
complex operations in libcwp.a to be performed using C++ complex
routines, rather than the C routines found in cwp/lib/complex.c.

To compile, type:   make

Programs for performing ray tracing in triangulated elastic media

ELARAY - ray tracing for elastic anisotropic models
ELACHECK - get elastic coefficients of model
ELATRIUNI - convert TRIangulated ELAstic models to UNIformly sampled models
ELAMODEL - make piecewise homogeneous anisotropic model
RAYDATA - simple program to display ray data from elaray
ELASYN - Elastic seismograms from triangulated models

Of these, "ELASYN" is not quite finished, and should be used with
care.

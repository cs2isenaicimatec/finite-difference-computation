This directory contains the routines for getpar parameter passing,
error reporting and error checking system calls and system subroutines.

The portability directory contains a version of errpkge.c using the older
varargs.h in case of non-ANSI port where stdargs.h is missing or defective.


Note: In the internal test driver for ealloc, I had to do a cast to
      get the compiler to accept free2 applied to **short. (jkc 04/90)

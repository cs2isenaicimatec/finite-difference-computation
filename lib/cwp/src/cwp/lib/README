This is the portable cwp library.  It needs only cwp.h to compile.
Among other things it contains:
	prime factor fft routines
	allocation of multi-dimensional arrays
	complex number manipulation
	big matrix handling routines
	interpolation routines
	Butterworth filters
	differentiator approximations
	sorting and searching routines
	LINPACK functions
	graphics utilities

The Mk.test contains an embryonic test suite.  You run it with
"make -f Mk.test <command>", where <command> is "test", "remake",
"compare".  This needs some more development as well as addition
of rest of the lib routines.

You may clone the data files ./Test/*.in to do testing of your own.


Thoughts:
	Need realloc routines (cf. SU's arraypkge) in alloc.c

	Perhaps add string table to pp1d along the lines of
	SU's tabplot for more flexible format (epsilon more
	efficient too).

	Should extract the program headers into a help file.

	The prototypes below from ..cwp/include/cwp.h should be
	converted into a NAME/PURPOSE list.

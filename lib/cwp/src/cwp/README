This is the top level of the CWP programming environment.
This code should port to any ANSI C conforming UNIX environment
without change.

A CWP directory directory typically contains:
	/include	the include file(s) for the lib & its Makefile
	/lib		the sub functions & their Makefile
	/main		general utility mains
Each of these usually has a README with specific information.

The second level of the CWP programming environment is contained
in the .../par directory.  It provides getpar parameter passing,
error reporting routines and analogs of system routines that check
for errors.

The third level of the CWP programming environment are applications
such as X routines, SU segy processing and so on.

----

The file DOC.cwplib contains the header notes and other information
about the .../cwp/lib routines.  Caveat: it may get out of date, so
also check the header notes of specific routines that interest you.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
If necessary, change the ROOT directory in the Makefile in this
directory (the default is $(CWPROOT)).  Create the needed
subdirectories:
	ROOT/include
	ROOT/lib
	ROOT/bin
After installation, if the ROOT was changed and you expect to
make changes/additions, update the Makefiles in the subdirectories.

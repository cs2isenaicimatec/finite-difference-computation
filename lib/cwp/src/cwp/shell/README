This directory contains some utility Bourne shell programs:

PROGRAM			PURPOSE
hangup.sh  		Force hangup at login prompt
locks.sh  		Which RCS files are locked in this directory?
motd.sh  		Pipe current motd to screen
news.sh  		Enhanced version of system program
overwrite.sh  		Overwrite file after executing command
precedence.sh  		Pump C precedences to screen
rcswho.sh  		Who can edit an RCS file?
replace.sh  		Replace string1 by string2 in files
type.sh  		Find all files of given type in this directory
unlock.sh  		Unlock an RCS file
usernames.sh  		List users on system
varlist.sh  		List fortran variables in file

Caveats:
The PAGE_PROGRAM variable in motd.sh, news.sh is system dependent.
No doubt, one could test for the existence of "more", etc., but it
seems more trouble than it's worth.

overwrite.sh requires possible modification and creation of "savedir"
directory.

replace.sh assumes local shells are in /usr/local/bin
unlock.sh assumes rcs executable is in /usr/local/bin

bigjobs.sh needs attention because of ps variations and is not in the makefile.

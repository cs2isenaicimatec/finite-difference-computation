# Create a 3D data set for Bill Wingle's block program--the
# name should end with ".su"
#
# This data set consists of one shot per line: the
# shotpoints move orthogonal to the receiver line
# with the scattering point below the midpoint of
# surface array.
#
# The data set consists of 32 receiver lines and 32 receivers per line 
# If your machine is fast enough, change nshot and nrec to 64 and change
# dsy and dgx to 50 to get a nicer data set that has 64 receiver lines
# and 64 receivers per line.

CAVEAT:  We didn't have a chance to check this demo before release 27.

The script MakeBlockData in this directory creates a data set of the
form required by the "block" program.

Once the data set is made, there are two ways to get the file into
block.  You can either use command line arguments, or you can execute
block and then load the file using the FILE:Open SU menu item.

To open a file using the command line, you must pass four arguments.
For the data created by the script MakeBlockData, the arguments are:

prompt> block -sul 32 -sur 32 -suf 1 data3d.su

where:	-sul = # of receiver lines
	-sur = # of receivers / line
	-suf = 0 file NOT SU format
	       1 file SU format

To open this file, or another SU file, directly from block, you use
the FILE:Open SU menu option.  In the pop-up dialog you need to
specify the number of receiver lines (32) and the number of receivers
/ line (32).  Block has no way of guessing what these are.  If you
give inappropriate values though it will warn you there is a problem,
and it will not draw anything.  It determines that there is a problem
if there are too few or too many records in the data file.

Tip: If you don't see hyperbolas on the vertical faces, use the
Palette menu.

Block is a program that is part of the Uncert package from Colorado
School of Mines

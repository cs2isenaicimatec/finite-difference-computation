Run the "gabor" scripts first. Then run the "tvband" scripts.

The "tvband" scripts depend on the data created by the "gabor"
scripts.

The idea of the demo is that "chirpy" data (i.e. data with time
varying frequency) are represented in the time-frequency domain via
sugabor. Three chirps are summed together and the result is plotted in
the time-frequency domain.

From the time frequency domain picture of the summed data, one can
select frequency-time regions of interest. Example: to reconstruct the
original 3 traces, one can use the time-frequency plot to select time
varying filters that will approximately isolate each of the
constituent chirps.  The time varying filtering is done with
"sutvband".

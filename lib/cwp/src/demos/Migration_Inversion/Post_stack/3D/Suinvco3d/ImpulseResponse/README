README for Impulse Response Demo

This code depends on the CWP/SU (Seismic Unix) package,
available free from the Center for Wave Phenomena at:
ftp.cwp.mines.edu

The program SUINVZCO3D implements Kirchhoff depth migration
on a synthetic data set. The traveltime and amplitude tables are generated 
by ray tracing.

To run demo, type:
Unif2		to compute the v(z) velocity profile and view  it;
Sudata		to generated spike data 
Suinvco3d	to migrate the synthetic data, runs approxiamtely
	        5min on a RS6000 530
Xplot		to view the cube as a movie looping through vertical
		slices in the 3D impulse response.
PSplot		to create PostScript cube plot.

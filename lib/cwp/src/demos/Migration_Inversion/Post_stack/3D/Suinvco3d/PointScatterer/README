README for the inversion of data from a Point Scatterer 

This code depends on the CWP/SU (Seismic Unix) package,
available free from the Center for Wave Phenomena at:
ftp.cwp.mines.edu

The program SUINVZCO3D implements Kirchhoff depth migration
on a synthetic data set. The traveltime and amplitude tables are generated 
by ray tracing.

To run demo, 
Unif2		Build the v(z) background wavespeed profile
Model		Build the synthetic point diffraction data
Suinvco3d	Migrate the synthetic data, runs approxiamtely
		5min on an RS6000 530
Xplot		movies of synthetic data an migrated image
PSplot		synthetic data and migrated image (PostScript cube plot)

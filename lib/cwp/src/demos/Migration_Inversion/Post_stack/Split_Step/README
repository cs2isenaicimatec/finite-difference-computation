Here I present a simple demo of sumigsplit migrating the synthetic data
generated by susynlv. There are four files under this directory:

README --instruction

genv.c -- Testing velocity generator

Xdemo -- Demo for X-window system. 

PSdemo -- Demo to produce a Postscript file -- /tmp/migsplit.ps, you will 
need a Postscript Viewer to see it.

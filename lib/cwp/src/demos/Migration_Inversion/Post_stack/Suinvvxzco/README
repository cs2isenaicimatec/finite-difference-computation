README for Suinvvxzco Demo 				15 March 1995

This demo depends on the CWP free software package
and the SU (seismic UNIX) package.


The program SUINVVXZ implements Kirchhoff-WKBJ
2D Inversion (true amplitude migration) on
a test data set created using SUSYNVXZ. The
exact background velocity profile is used for
the inversion in this demo. The input datatype
for SUINVVXZ is in the su-form.

To run demo, type:
Unif2      to compute the v(x,z) velocity profile
Smooth     to smooth the v(x,z) velocity profile
Xmod       view original and smoothed v(x,z) profiles (X-windows output)
PSmod      view original and smoothed v(x,z) profiles (PostScript output)
Susynvxz   to compute the synthetic seismograms
Suinvvxzco   to invert the synthetic seismograms
Xplot      view the synthetic data and inverted image (X-windows output)
PSplot      view the synthetic data and inverted image (PostScript output)

SUMIGGBZO -SU MIGration by Gaussian Beams for Zero Offset data

Demo1 is the gaussian beam migration of a synthetic data
set consisting of 101 traces, with only one trace being nonzero,
assuming a constant background wavespeed of 
2.0 (spatial samples/time samples).
The synthetic data are generated by the program   makesyn
and the necessary background velocity profile is generated
by the program   makevel.  The source code for both of these 
programs is in the directory ./model.dir

Prerequisites:
The CWP open source software packages:  cwp, par, and su
must be installed on your system for the Demos to run.
The demo codes depend on   libcwp.a libpar.a.
These may be obtained from the Center for Wave Phenomena on
request.

ROOT path:
The standard ROOT path that we use here at CWP is
/usr/local/cwp. You will have to change this to reflect
the arrangement that exists on your system.
Please edit the ./model.dir/Makefile accordingly,
before you run the Demo.


RUNNING the DEMO:
Type:

Model		To create the synthetic data

The result will be the creation of the model data and
the background velocity profile. Both will be
displayed on the screen using suxmovie.


Miggbzo		 To perform the Gaussian Beam Migration 

The result is the Gaussian Beam migration of the data created
by the Model shell, using the background velocity profile
created above. 

Note: 
The user may use makesyn and makevel to create other 
data and/or background velocity profiles to test SUMIGGBZO.
See the contents of the directories  model.dir and miggbzo.dir,
as well as the shells Model and Miggbzo for details.

Cleaning up:
When you are finished running the Demo, you may type
Clean to remove all temporary files associated with the Demo.

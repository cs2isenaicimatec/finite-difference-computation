SUMIGGBZO -SU MIGration by Gaussian Beams for Zero Offset data
"Marathon Model"

Demo4 is the gaussian beam migration of a synthetic data
set consisting of 250 traces, 500 data points per trace,
assuming a constant background wavespeed of 11750.

The synthetic data are generated by the CWP public
domain program   cshot  and the necessary background 
velocity profile is generated
by the program  unisam2.    These codes are part of the
CWP open source software packages.

Prerequisites:
The CWP open source software packages:  cwp, par, and su
must be installed on your system for the Demos to run.
The demo codes depend on   libcwp.a libpar.a.
These may be obtained from the Center for Wave Phenomena on
request.

ROOT path:
The standard ROOT path that we use here at CWP is
/usr/local/cwp. You will have to change any occurrences
of the path name to reflect
the arrangement that exists on your system.

RUNNING the DEMO:

To create the synthetic data
Type:
% Model

The result will be a zero-offset seismic section over
a multilayer model, with piecewise constant wavespeeds.
The model and synthetic data will be displayed on the
screen using the program  suxmovie.

To perform the Gaussian Beam Migration
Type:
% Miggbzo

The result will be the Gaussian Beam Migration of the
synthetic data, assuming a constant background velocity
of 11750. The background velocity profile is created
using the  program   unisam2.

Note:
The user may use CSHOT to create other model data,
and may use unisam2 to create other background wavespeed
profiles to test  sumiggbzo. See the contents of
model.dir and miggbzo.dir, as well as the shell scripts
Model and Miggbzo for details. For details regarding
CSHOT see CWP Report U-08 (CSHOT documentation).

Cleaning up:
When you are finished running the Demo, you may type
Clean to remove all temporary files associated with the Demo.

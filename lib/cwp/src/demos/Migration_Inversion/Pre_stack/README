Prestack migration demos			31 July 2003

Run the following shell scripts:

XData			create model data using suimp2d

The data are generated with suimp2d and are k-domain filtered
to prevent spatial aliasing problems in later processing. Two
files are created. The first is a single shot over a point scatterer.
The second is a 10 shot profile over the scatter.

Plots consist of the data and k-domain representations of the data.

	prestack migrations for a single shot gather:
Xsplit1shot		Split-Step
Xfd1shot		Finite Difference
Xffd1shot		Fourier Finite Difference
Xpspi1shot		Phase Shift Plus Interpolation

Plots consist of
migration result, k-domain representation, and theoretical
k-domain apertures, computed using kaperture.

	prestack migrations for a line of 10 shots:

Xsplit10shots		Split-Step
Xfd10shots		Finite Difference
Xffd10shots		Fourier Finite Difference
Xpspi10shot		Phase Shift Plus Interpolation

Plots consist of
migration result, k-domain representation, and theoretical
k-domain apertures, computed using kaperture.

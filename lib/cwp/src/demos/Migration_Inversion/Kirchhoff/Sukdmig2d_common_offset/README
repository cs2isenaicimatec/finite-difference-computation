README for SUKDMIG2D					16 Feb 1994

CAVEAT: X Windows plotting not complete for version 27.

This code depends on the CWP/SU (Seismic Unix) package,
available free from the Center for Wave Phenomena at:
ftp.cwp.mines.edu

The program SUKDMIG2D implements Kirchhoff depth migration
on a synthetic data set. The traveltime tables are generated 
by rayt2d

To run demo, type:
Unif2      to compute the v(x,z) velocity profile and view  it;
PSmod      view v(x,z) profile (PostScript output);
Xmod      view v(x,z) profile (PostScript output);
Rayt2d 	   to generate traveltime tables;
PStime     view the traveltime tables (PostScript output)
Xtime      movie of traveltime tables (X-windows output)
Synlv      to generated  synthetic seismograms
Sukdmig2d  to migrate the synthetic seismograms
Xplot      view the synthetic data and migrated image (X-windows output)
PSplot     view the synthetic data and migrated image (PostScript output)

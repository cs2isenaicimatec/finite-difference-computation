Suocext - Offset continuation extrapolation

To run the demos, type the name of the demo shell script
on the commandline of a terminal window.

Demo shell scripts:

Xsucoext 	Offset continuation, X-window graphics
PSsucoext 	Offset continuation, PostScript graphics

The program "sucoext" performs "offset continuation" meaning
that it continues the offsets of data to a smaller offset. The
demo shows the extrapolation of the common offset reflection
seismic data with offset=25m, using as input the common offset
reflection data made with offset of 175m.

The plots show model generated 25m offset data and model generated
175m data, the extrapolated 25m offset data, and the difference
between the model generated and extrapolated 25m data.

Demo for Kirchhoff datuming				11 Dec 1996

This demo depends on the CWP/SU Seismic Unix package available from:
http://www.cwp.mines.edu/cwpcodes  
or
ftp://ftp.cwp.mines.edu/pub/cwpcodes

To run demo, type the following shell script names on the commandline
in the order listed:

Synlv			generate synthetic data with SUSYNLV (approx 5min)
Unif2_datum		generate wavespeed profile
Rayt2d_up		generate ray tracing traveltime tables
Sudatum_up		moves (flat) data to given reference surface 
                        to simulate seismic data collected on a different
			surface. (may take up to 2 hours on P5-120 system)
PSplot			plot a single shot gather recorded on a non-flat
 			surface (PostScript)
Xplot			plot a single shot gather recorded on a non-flat
 			surface (X-windows)

Note that this collection of operations may be used to remove the
effects of topography from seismic data. Here it is being use to
generate data with topographic effects for use in other demos.

Demo for Kirchhoff datuming				11 Dec 1996

You need to run the demo in the ../Make_Data directory to make the
data for this demo.

To run demo, type the following shell script names on the commandline
in the order listed:

Unif2_datum		generate wavespeed profile
Rayt2d_down		generate ray tracing traveltime tables
Sudatum_down		moves data with topography to given datum surface 
PSplot			plot a single shot gather recorded on a non-flat
 			surface (PostScript)
Xplot			plot a single shot gather recorded on a non-flat
 			surface (X-windows)

Note that this collection of operations may be used to remove the
effects of topography from seismic data. Here it is being use to
generate data with topographic effects for use in other demos.

This directory is used to compute a synthetic zero-offset
section over a model with a topographic surface, a variable
base of weathering and a reflector at depth.  After running
Xcshot, the model is displayed.  The uppermost surface is
the recording surface, the second surface is the base of
weathering, and the third surface is a reflector which
contains a syncline.  The final datum is horizontal and is
at depth of 600 m on the final model.  Note, that is just
below the deepest portion of the base of weathering, so the
reflection from the weathering base should not be present
after the datuming.

The code SUDATUMFD must have the source-receiver positions
stored in the header values in order to perform the datuming
correctly, so headers are set in Xcshot.


To make and view the Earth model and test data for the demo type:
Xcshot                 displays model, generates and displays data
                       in Xwindows
or 

PScshot                displays model, generates and writes data to
                       postscript file

In this directory, four files are created:  sources statics,
receiver statics, thin-lens term velocity file, diffraction
term velocity file.  There are two different velocity files,
to account for the intermediate statics step with the
thin-lens term without using the diffraction term to
collapse diffractions in the data.

To create the model velocity data, type:

Zero                   creates statics files and near-surface
                       velocity model files

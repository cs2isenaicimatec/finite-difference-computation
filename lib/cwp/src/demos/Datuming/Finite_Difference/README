This directory illustrates the use of a 2D acoustic
implicit-finite-difference wave-equation datuming code.  If you
are new to SU, start by reading "The SU User's Manual" and the
README in $CWPROOT/src/demos.

To run the demo:

to make the model data:

cd MakeData/           go to directory to create data

and follow the instructions in the README file there

To make the model statics corrections:

cd VelocityFiles    go to directory for statics and
                       velocity model computation

and follow the instructions in the README file there

To apply the datuming and view the results return to
this directory and type:

Proc                   applies static shifts and wave-equation
                       datuming

then execute one of the following shell scripts to view the model, the
model data, and final results of the datuming:

Xdisplay               displays results with Xwindows
  or
PSdisplay              saves results as postscript files

Note:  The final datum is placed at a depth of 600 m on the
model generated with Xcshot or PScshot.

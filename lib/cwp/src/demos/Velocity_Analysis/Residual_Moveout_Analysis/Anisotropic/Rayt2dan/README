README for RAYT2DAN          Debashish Sarkar	Dec 2003                      

This code depends on the CWP/SU (Seismic Unix) package,
available free from the Center for Wave Phenomena at:
ftp.cwp.mines.edu

The program RAYT2DAN computes traveltime tables for P- and SV-waves
in a transversely isotropic medium with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI)
for arbitary, but smooth, variation in the medium parameters. The output
traveltime tables may be used for modeling and migration.

The demo shows an application of the code for a linear variation
in medium parameters computed for a single shot placed at 1000 m
on the surface. 

Type:

Rayt2dan  -- demo for rayt2dan
Clean.sh  -- clean up after running the demo

The output on the screen allows the user to
monitor progress realtime by showing the shotpoint location
and the takeoff angle off each computed ray.

This is the main directory devoted to illustrating normal moveout
corrections and stacking.  If you are new to SU, start by reading
"The SU User's Manual" and the README in $CWPROOT/src/demos.

To run the demo with X Windows,  type name of shell script:
Xmodel     show the model (X-windows plot)
MakeData   make the synthetic traces for the demo
Xdata      show the data (X-windows plot)
Velan      interactive velocity analysis demo to build parameter
           file necessary for Xnmo
Xnmo	   show the nmo and stack (X-windows graphics)
Xvelocity  view an image plot of the picked velocities
Clean      remove temporary files created by the demo

(Caveat:  users without . on their path must type:   ./Shell_Name )

Versions with PostScript output, type:
PSmodel    show the model (PostScript plot)
PSdata     show the data (PostScript plot)
PSnmo	   show the nmo and stack (PostScript graphics)

File to be saved:
model      necessary for the "model" portions of the demo, do not remove.

You may type:
zap xgraph	to remove all xgraph/suxgraph plots
zap ximage	to remove all ximage/suximage plots
zap xwigb	to remove all xwigb/suwigb plots

When you make your velocity picks, you are assuming that the
coefficients were computed as if the model had the constant
velocities (ft/s): 5000.0, 6000.0, 8000.0, 10000.0, 15000.0
in the layers delimited by depths (ft): 0, 1000.0, 2200.0,
3500.0, 5000.0.  However, the modeling program (susynlv)
generates the data according to a linear velocity profile,
here taken as: 5000.0 + 0.002*z.

For shell examples used with real data, see the files Velan,
Velan.nmo, and NmoStack in the
	$CWPROOT/src/su/examples subdirectory.

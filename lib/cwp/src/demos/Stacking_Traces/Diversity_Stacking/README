README for SUDIVSTACK demo

Author: Mary Palen-Murphy, Geophysics Department, Colorado School of
        Mines

Sudivstack is a shell script which creates a field shot record; duplicates 
the shot record four times; adds noise to one of the shot records;
 (3 with no noise and one with noise).   These duplicate field shot 
records are then stacked using sustack (equally weighted) and sudivstack 
(diversity stack), for comparison.

Usage:

README for Synthetic Seismogram demos

The demo in each subdirectory is executed via the Xdemo shell script.

Demo1:
This demo creates a simple syncline model, shows the
fan of rays reflected from a split spread common
shot array, and shows the synthetic seismograms
(generated via Gaussian Beams) that would be recorded.

Demo2:
This demo shows the simple syncline model, the triangulation
plot, a zero offset seismic section, and finite (common) offset
seismic section.

Demo3:
This demo shows the salt dome  model, a ray plot,
and the common shot seismic section for reflections
from an salt dome overhang.

Demo4:
This demo shows a multimedia model with synclines, a complicated
ray plot, and the common shot seismic section for reflections
from the lower syncline in the model.

Demo5:
This demo shows a multimedia model with synclines,
and 3 sets of zero offset seismic sections with
different options to avoid Gaussian beam artifacts.

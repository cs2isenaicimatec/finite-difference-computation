README for Ray demos.


Warning: the PS demos require that the PSPREVIEWER environment 
         variable be set to be your PostScript Previewer.
         If you wish to save the output in files, you will
         have to edit the PS* shell scripts, accordingly.


PSray1 and Xray1  show the fan of rays obliquely reflected from the 3rd
		  reflector in a simple 4 media model

PSray2 and Xray2  show the wavefronts and ray paths for the fan of
		  rays shown in PSray1 and Xray1
	          
PSray3 and Xray3  show the wavefronts and ray paths for a fan of rays
                  vertically incident on the same reflector as the
		  previous two models

PSray4 and Xray4  show several fans of rays reflected from boundaries
                  in the Cerveny model.

PSray5 and Xray5  show a collection of multiply reflected ray fans
		  in the 4 media model

PSray6 and Xray6  show 2 reflected rays and their associated Fresnel volumes
                  in the Cerveny model

The PSdemos are show rays, wavefronts, and/or Fresnel volumes
overlaying the model. The Xdemos show these same things in separate
windows.

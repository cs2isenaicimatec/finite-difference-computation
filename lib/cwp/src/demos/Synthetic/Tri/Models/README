Demos for Delaunay Triangulation

Based on original "GBmod" by Andreas Rueger.

These examples will familiarize you with the
model builder used in GBmod. The following sequence
of increasingly complicated demos is designed to 
explain the use of the key parameters and the display
options. 

The contents of this directory are ready-to-run shell scripts 
that are executed by typing the name of the shell script
on the command line of a UNIX terminal window.

Two modes of output are supported. The shell scripts
prefixed by the letters "PS" produce Encapsulated PostScript file output,
with the feature that if the user specifies a PostScript
previewer, via the environment variable PSPREVIEWER,
these files will be displayed on the screen.  The shell scripts
prefixed by the letter "X", produce X-windows output.

The models displayed are:

# Model 1 - constant sloth (and hence constant wavespeed) medium

# Model 2 :  two constant sloth media in contact with a syncline/anticline

# Model 3: Simple 4 media model

# Model 4:  Cerveny (multi layer model with a lens and fault)

# Model 5: Salt dome model

Note: These are triangulated model plots, *not* ray diagrams.

Warning: If you get a "BUS error or other Memory error" from a
model you create, check to see that all of the boundaries are
defined correctly. At this time there is minimal error trapping in
"trimodel" for such cases.

These demos depend on the programs:
trimodel, spsplot, and sxplot

The self-documentation (selfdoc) of each of these programs may be obtained
by typing the name of the program (followed by a carriage return)
on a UNIX terminal window.

README for the demos for Tri

The demos contained in these subdirectories show the user how
to 1) build 1/(velocity)^2 models  2) trace rays 3) generate 
synthetic seismograms using the Gaussian beam method.

The contents of each directory are shell scripts that are executed
by typing the name of the shell script on the command line
of a UNIX terminal window. Parallel sets of demos are provided to
generate PostScript (PS) output or for X-window (X) output.

In addition, users may set the environment variable $PSPREVIEWER
in their working shell environment to permit the PostScript output
to be viewed directly on the screen.

Please read the README file in each subdirectory for further instructions
on running the Demos.  Begin in the Models directory, then run the
demos in the Rays directory. Finally, run the demos in the Seismograms
directory.

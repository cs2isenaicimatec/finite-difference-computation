Demo shell scripts for wavelet generation with SUWAVEFORM

SUWAVEFORM generates a seismic wavelet defined by a wavelet type, 
its frequency content and possibly other parameters. The demo shell
scripts in this directory illustrate the generation of AKB and
zero-phase Ricker wavelets with different frequency content, and
of more complex Berlage wavelets. Each demo is available as a
version with X window display or PostScript (PS) output.

To run one of the demo listed below, type the name of the demo shell 
script on the commandline of a terminal window.

Demo shell scripts: 
    Xsuwaveform1    AKB and Ricker wavelets (X window display)
    PSsuwaveform1   AKB and Ricker wavelets (PS plots)
    Xsuwaveform2    Berlage wavelets (X window display)
    PSsuwaveform2   Berlage wavelets (PS plots)
    Clean.sh        Remove files created by these scripts

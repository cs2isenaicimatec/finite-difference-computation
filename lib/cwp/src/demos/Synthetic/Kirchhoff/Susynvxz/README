README for SUSYNVXZ demo				10 Jun 1993

This demo creates synthetic seismograms in SEGY format
using a Kirchhoff-WKBJ method, for v(x,z) velocity models.
The WKBJ parameters are calculated via finite differencing.

Makevel		creates the v(x,z) velocity model

Susynvxz	creates the synthetic seismograms

Xplot		displays the output of Susynvxz on an X-windows system

PSplot		makes PostScript files for the output of Susynvxz

Clean		cleans up after running demos


Note: this is a long running demo of a realistic model
      Timing results for on Pentium 100 MHz:
	318.200u 8.060s 6:52.64 79.0% 0+0k 0+0io 48pf+0
	(so in particular, about 7 minutes clock time)

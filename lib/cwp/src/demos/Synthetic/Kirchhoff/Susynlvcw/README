README for SUDMOCWFK  Demo

The shell script Xsusylvcw creates a synthetic data set (filename:
data.seis) using the public domain code, SUSYNLVCW. The data is in the form
of seismic traces in SEGY format, sorted in cdp gathers.

Please read the script carefully. The default setting
is to generate 1 cdp gather. The user may increase or
decrease the number of cdp gathers created. The 126 cdp's
by 125 traces data set is representative of those used
by Mohammend Alfaraj in his doctoral dissertation. 

See the selfdoc of 'susynlvcw' for additional information.

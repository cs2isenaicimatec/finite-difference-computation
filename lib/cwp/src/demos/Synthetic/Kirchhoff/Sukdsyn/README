README for SUKDSYN2D					26 July 1995

The program SUKDSYN2D implements Kirchhoff depth synthesis
on a migrated seismic section.

The program SUKDSYN2D takes a migrated seismic section and a set of travel time
tables generated using RAYT2D for a specific background velocity model
and generates synthetic seismic data in the form of common shot gathers.
(Common offset gathers may be generated by using nxo=1.)	

This program is a tool which may be used for the migration residual
statics estimation technique of Tjan, Audebert, and Larner 1994.

To run demo, type the name of each shell script in the order listed here:
Suplane    to generate three-plane synthetic data
Xmod       to view plane data (X-windows)
PSmod       to view plane data (PostScript output)
Unif2      to compute the v(x,z) velocity profile;
Rayt2d 	   to generate traveltime tables;
Sukdmig2d  to migrate the synthetic seismograms
Sukdsyn2d  to synthesize seismograms from migrated section
Xplot      view the synthesized data and migrated section (X-windows output)
PSplot     view the synthesized data and migrated section (PostScript output)

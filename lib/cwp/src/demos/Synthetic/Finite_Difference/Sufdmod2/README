This directory is devoted to illustrating the use of the sufdmod2
finite difference modeling program.  If you are new to SU, start by
reading "The SU User's Manual" and/or the main demo README.

X Window Demo Files:

XDemo1 A movie showing the time response to an impulse
XDemo2 Shows the three auxiliary files produced by sufdmod2
XDemo3 A movie showing waves from an impulse propagating through a
        multilayer model
XDemo4 Synthetic seismograms from XDemo3
XDemo5 A larger synthetic dataset
XDemo6 application of the PML absorbing boundary conditions

When the time echo from the movie in XDemo1 stops, hit return and
execute XDemo2.

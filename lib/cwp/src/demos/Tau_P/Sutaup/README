Demo for SUTAUP 


Author: Gabriel Alvarez
Notes:
Computes the forward or inverse tau-p transform in t-x or f-k domain.


To run Demo, type:

Model		to create the data set
Sutaup		shows input data
		the forward tau-p transformed data,
		the cascade of the forward and inverse transformed data,
		the difference between the input data and the cascaded
		data.

Note:
Only relative amplitudes are preserved in this implementation, so
the output of the cascade of forward and inverse transforms must
be scaled before comparisons (like differencing) can be made.

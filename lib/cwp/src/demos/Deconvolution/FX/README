Sufxdecon - random noise attenuation via F-X deconvolution

To run the demos, type the name of the demo shell script
on the commandline of a terminal window.

Demo shell scripts:

Xsufxdecon 	FX decon X-window graphics
PSsufxdecon 	FX decon PostScript graphics

The program "sufxdecon" performs random noise attenuation via
spatial deconvolution on data in the F-X domain.

The plot titled "Signal" shows three reflectors without noise.
The plot titled "Data" shows the same reflectors with random noise
added (via "suaddnoise").  The second column of plots shows the
FX deconvolution over the "Signal" and "Data" datasets. The final
column shows the difference between the original data, and the FX
deconvolved data.

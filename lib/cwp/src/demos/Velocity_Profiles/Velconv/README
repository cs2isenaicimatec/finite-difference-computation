In this directory, we created a velocity profile with unif2
and apply velconv to convert this velocity profile, considered
now as a v(x,t) function, into different types.

If you are new to SU, start by reading "The SU User's Manual" and the
README in $CWPROOT/src/demos.

The X demos pop up several examples. These demo scripts are
meant to be READ.  Then you can clone what you need for your
application.

XVelconv      build a velocity profile and perform velocity
              conversions with velconv

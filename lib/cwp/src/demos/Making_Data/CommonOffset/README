This directory is devoted to illustrating the construction of shot
gathers with susynlv.

To run the demo with X Windows, type:
XZeroOffset       construction and labeling of zero offset sections
XCommonOffset     construction and labeling of non-zero offset gathers
XLabelDifficulty  examine a difficulty when fxm=0.0

To run with PostScript output files execute PSZeroOffset instead of
XZeroOffset, etc.

OffsetHeaders	shows the header fields set by susynlv in offset mode

Notes: In addition to the executable shells, this demo requires
the model files: model00deg, model20deg, model40deg, model60deg
that are in the directory (please do not erase these!).

This directory is devoted to illustrating the construction of shot
gathers with susynlv.

To run demos with X Windows, type:
XSingleShot       construction and labeling of single shot gathers
XMultipleShots    construction and labeling of multiple shot gathers (we
                  add a bit of noise to this one)
XLabelDifficulty  examine a difficulty when fx0=0.0

To run with PostScript output files execute PSSingleShot instead of
XSingleShot, etc.

ShotHeaders	shows the header fields set by susynlv in shot mode (see
                the Filtering/Sufilter demos for setting more fields)

Notes: In addition to the executable shells, this demo requires
the model files: model00deg, model20deg, model40deg, model60deg
that are in the directory (please do not erase these!).

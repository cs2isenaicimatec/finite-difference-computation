README for SUDIPDIVCOR  Demo 				25 Jun 1993

The shell script Model creates a synthetic data set (filename:
data.seis) using the public domain code, SUSYNLV. The data is
a single cdp gather in the form of seismic traces in SEGY format.

See the selfdoc of 'susynlv' for additional information.
(Simply type:  susynlv to see the selfdoc)

The shell script Dipdivcor performs the conventional and
dip-dependent divergence corrections on the data in 'data.seis'.
This shell script is written to process the data set created
by the 'Model' shell script. However, the user may substitute
his/her own SEGY formatted, cdp sorted data files.

See the selfdoc of 'sudmofkcw' for additional information.
(Simply type:  sudmofkcw to see the selfdoc)

To create the input data, type:  
Model

To perform the divergence correction demo
Dipdivcor

When these shells finish, you may view the data on X-windows systems
by typing:
Xplot

or as PostScript output by typing:
PSplot

To view the PostScript file, you need to set the environment variable:
PSPREVIEWER
in your working shell. If your working shell is Korn Shell (ksh)
put the line:

export PSPREVIEWER=/your/PostScript_previewer
in your .profile

If your working shell is C-shell (csh), then add the  line:
setenv PSPREVIEWER /your/PostScript_previewer

where /your/PostScript_previewer is the program you prefer to
use to view PostScript output. The program 'xepsp' that is
part of the CWP Public Domain codes is an X-windows PostScript
previewer written at CWP.

If you have questions about this code please contact.

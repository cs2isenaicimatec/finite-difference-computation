related commands.

Xsort  -- shell that runs the Demo using X-Windows
PSsort -- shell that runs the Demo using PostScript

Clean -- Removes the model data and the output data sets

Commands_Only -- Contains the commands used in the Demo (for convenience
		 in cloning your own processing streams)

data.far	"common offset" section of far traces
data.fullfold	section windowed to region of full fold (fold=3)
data.near	"common offset" section of near traces
data.recgather	original data sorted to receiver gathers"
data.seis	original (model) data
data.sortdown	data sorted up on cdp and down on offset
data.stack	stacked data from full fold region
data.unsort	data.sortdown resorted up on offset (= data.fullfold)

README  ---- WKBJ                                10 Jun 1993

The program 'wkbj' uses finite differencing to compute
the ray theoretic parameters necessary for modeling
the acoustic wavefield with ray tracing.

Makevel       To generate velocity profile that is a function of (x,z)
Wkbj          To compute ray theoretic parameters as a function of (x,z)
Xplot         To display the output of Wkbj on an X-windows system
PSplot        To display the output of Wkbj using a PostScript previewer
Clean         To clean up after running demos.

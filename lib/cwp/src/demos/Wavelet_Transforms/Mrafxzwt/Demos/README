MRAFXZWT	CWP Proprietary Code 		U-40	17 February 1997

This code is Proprietary to the Consortium Project on Seismic Inverse
Methods for Complex Structures until March 2000.

Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) of a function F(X,Z) by Wavelet Transform.

XGrid		MRA of a 2D test grid; X-windows graphics
PSGrid		MRA of a 2D test grid; PostScript graphics
ShowWavelet	Show the Daubechies' wavelet being used for the MRA
XSine		MRA of a 2D Sine data set; X-windows graphics
PSSine		MRA of a 2D Sine data set; PostScript graphics

For 3D plots of the output of XSine and PSSine, see:
 http://www.cwp.mines.edu/~zmeng/waveletlab/badvcompression/badvcompression.html

The following shell scripts require the Marmousi dataset.
XMarmousi	MRA of the Marmousi model; X-windows Graphics
PSMarmousi	MRA of the Marmousi model; PostScript Graphics

See: http://www.cwp.mines.edu/~zmeng/waveletlab/Marmousi/Marmousi.html
for more information.


Xrandom		Random noise filtering by Multi Resolution Analysis
		This shell demonstrates the ability to perform different
		levels of resolution for each dimension, and to transform
		only the lower level of the resolution back to the original
		domain of the data.

PSrandom	PostScript version of Xrandom

Clean		Clean up after demo

You may also type:
zap xmovie
zap xgraph

to remove all X-windows plots from screen.

David Forel's update.

When verbose=1 in supickamp, each trace's calculations (below)
are written in a group.

trace 9 x=9.000000 t_above=0.120000 t_below=0.130000
trace #=9          x2=9.000000e+00
max=1.477612e-01         tmax=1.260000e-01
min=4.069824e-02         tmin=1.200000e-01
abs=1.477612e-01         tabs=1.260000e-01
energy in pick window =1.395384e-04

Instead, when verbose=2, each trace's calculations are written
in one tab-delimited row. This is convenient for input to
another program for further processing or plotting.

Before the output of supickamp are input to another program,
the user will want to remove the last 7 lines of global values
and might want to remove the first line of column titles.

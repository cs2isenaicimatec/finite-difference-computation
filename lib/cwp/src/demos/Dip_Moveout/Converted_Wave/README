README for SUDMOCWFK  Demo

The shell script Model creates a synthetic data set (filename:
data.seis) using the public domain code, SUSYNLVCW. The data is in the form
of seismic traces in SEGY format, sorted in cdp gathers.

Please read the Model script carefully. The default setting
is to generate 1 cdp gather. The user may increase or
decrease the number of cdp gathers created. The 126 cdp's
by 125 traces data set is representative of those used
by Mohammend Alfaraj in his doctoral dissertation. 

See the selfdoc of 'susynlvcw' for additional information.
(Simply type:  susynlvcw to see the selfdoc)

The shell script DMOCW performs  Converted Wave Dip Moveout on
data sorted in to CDP gathers. The input file 'data.seis',
consists of seismic traces in SEGY format, sorted by 'cdp' number.
This shell script is written to process the data set created
by the 'Model' shell script (default of 1 cdp gather).
However, the user may substitute his/her own SEGY formatted,
cdp sorted data files. 

See the selfdoc of 'sudmofkcw' for additional information.
(Simply type:  sudmofkcw to see the selfdoc)

To create the input data, type:  
Model

To perform the Converted Wave DMO on the data in data.seis type:
DMOCW

When these shells finish, you may view the data on X-windows systems
by typing:
Xplot

or as PostScript output by typing:
PSplot

To view the PostScript file, you need to set the environment variable:
PSPREVIEWER
in your working shell. If your working shell is Korn Shell (ksh)
put the line:

export PSPREVIEWER=/your/PostScript_previewer
in your .profile

If your working shell is C-shell (csh), then add the  line:
setenv PSPREVIEWER /your/PostScript_previewer

where /your/PostScript_previewer is the program you prefer to
use to view PostScript output. The program 'xepsp' that is
part of the CWP Public Domain codes is an X-windows PostScript
previewer written at CWP.

Note: the user may wish to window the output via:

suwind < infilename key=tracl min=1 max=20 | ...

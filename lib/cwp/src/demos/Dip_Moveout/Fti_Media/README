Susynlvfti - creates synthetic data using SUSYNLVFTI. The data file
             is called: cmgsynhti

Testd - Performs various types of DMO processing


To run demo, set S= parameter in each of the demo shell scripts
to a convenient location. Type the name of the shell script to execute
the demo. Run Susynlvfti first to create the synthetic data.
Then run Testd to perform the TI VZ DMO. Graphical output showing

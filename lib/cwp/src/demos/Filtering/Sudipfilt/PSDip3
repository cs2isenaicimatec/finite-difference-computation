amps=1,0,0,1	# In this demo, we try to kill a reflector of given slope

###MODEL###
# We make some simple data with suplane.  Note that in units of
# trace/timesample the default slopes in suplane are 0, 1, 2, so
# that the middle reflector is spatially just at Nyquist and the
# the steepest reflector is spatially aliased.
#
# In this demo, we use the nominal physical units in sudipfilt which
# are dt=4ms and dx=d2=0.016km=16m.  Thus the slopes of the three
# reflectors are {0,1,2}*0.004/0.016={0,1/4,1/2}

# First make the synthetic data for the dip filtering demo.
# Assume that trace spacing is measured in km.
dx=0.016

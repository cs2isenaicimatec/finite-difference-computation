This directory is the beginning of a demo devoted to illustrating
filtering and muting to "clean up" some real data contaminated with
ground roll.  It will be analogous to the study in the parallel
directory, Sufilter.   These activities are derived from exercises from John
Scales's "Theory of Seismic Imaging", Samizdat Press, available from
this ftp site.  See that text for full explanations and extensions.

The data set required in this demo (and in the demos in ../Sufilter)
is shotgather #25 from the Oz Yilmaz collection. These gathers are
all available by anonymous ftp:

ftp ftp.cwp.mines.edu
directory is pub/data/oz.migration.notes
files are oz25.F and oz25.H

ATTENTION: If you are on a "big endian" machine (e.g., IBM RS6000,
SUN,etc.)  you must run MakeDataBig before running the main demo to
make the data set, data.su.  Similarly, run MakeDataLittle to make
this data set on a "little endian" machine (e.g., DEC, PC's).

The PSDemo is not practical to run--the existing file is just
a placeholder.  The XDemo shows a nice movie of the trace
by trace Gabor transforms.

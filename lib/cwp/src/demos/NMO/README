This is the main directory devoted to illustrating normal moveout
corrections and stacking.  If you are new to SU, start by reading
"The SU User's Manual" and the README in $CWPROOT/src/demos.

To run the demo with X Windows, type:
Xmodel     show the model
MakeData   make the synthetic traces for the demo
Xdata      show the data
Xvelocity  look at velocity scans, in reality would make interactively
           with $CWPROOT/src/su/examples/Velan
           makes parameter file for sunmo
Xnmo	   show the nmo and stack

Clean      clean up the data
Xall       run the entire X demo

To run with PostScript output files execute PSmodel instead of
Xmodel, etc.


Notes:
In addition to the above shell files, the demo requires the files:
model, cdp.1500, cdp.2000, cdp.2500, cdp.3000, so do not erase them!
The file stkvel.p is recreated by Xvelocity or PSvelocity.

The velocity picks were honestly made from the semblance
plots shown in the demo, but the velocity profile in the
demo is not at all like the real thing!  The reflection
coefficients were computed as if the model had the constant
velocities (ft/s): 5000.0, 6000.0, 8000.0, 10000.0, 15000.0
in the layers delimited by depths (ft): 0, 1000.0, 2200.0,
3500.0, 5000.0.  However, the modeling program (susynlv)
generates the data according to a linear velocity profile,
here taken as: 5000.0 + 0.002*z.

For shell examples used with real data, see the files Velan,
Velan.nmo, and NmoStack in the
	$CWPROOT/src/su/examples subdirectory.

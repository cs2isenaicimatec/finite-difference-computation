Program sukeycount writes the key and the count to the
terminal or a text file when a change of key occurs. This
does not provide a unique key count (see SUCOUNTKEY for
that).

Note that for key values  1 2 3 4 2 5
value 2 is counted once per occurrence since this program
only recognizes a change of key, not total occurrence.

This program is most useful for getting CMP fold when the
input data are sorted in cdp order.

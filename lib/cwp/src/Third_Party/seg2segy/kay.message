Earlier this year I had forwarded to you a version of the SEG2 to SEGY
programme that I had modified.  I noticed in the current version of SU
that it is filed in the Third_Party directory, but it was incorrectly
described as not requiring the auxillary keyword file of the original
version.  This wasn't true, but you have shamed me into producing a
version for which that is an accurate statement!  Well, that and always
having to explain to people why they need that file.  

So, the current version checks for an environment variable or a default
place for the keyword file, and if it doesn't find it, then it generates
its own internal defaults.  Thus only one source file is needed, with no
extra keyword files.  Somewhat better.  

The other advantage of automagically determining the byte order is still 
build in to the code.  I've attached a copy for you of this new version.
No fancy make file should be required.  I've tested it on  solaris and 
linux against previous versions and the output is identical.  I've not
tested it on DOS machines, but the additions use standard C library calls,
so it shouldn't be a problem.


Installation instructions:

many years ago I also worked with SUMMIT SEG2 data and ran into  
similar problems (seg2segy conversion with minor warnings, SU data  
unusable). I was told that the SUMMIT SEG2 format differs from the  
format expected by the seg2segy program. The solution was to "fix"  
the SUMMIT SEG2 format using a program called seg2fix before running  
seg2segy. However, I don't remember if I had to use seg2fix also on  
later SUMMIT surveys.

Anyway, attached you will find "seg2fix.c", which can be compiled  
e.g. with "gcc -o seg2fix seg2fix.c".

Your data conversion procedure may then look like
     seg2fix rec0003.sg2
     seg2segy rec0003.sg2 1
     segyread tape=rec0003.sgy endian=0 > rec0003.su

Note that seg2fix modifies your input SEG2 file (here rec0003.sg2),  
i.e. try it on a _copy_ of your data!
I did all SUMMIT SEG2 data conversion on a SUN.
Good luck!

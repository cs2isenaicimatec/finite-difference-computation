README   Third Party Software					15 August 1996

The contents of this directory are software that have
been donated to us by members of the SU users community.
While we intend to incorporate these codes into the CWP/SU
package eventually, we have decided to make them available
in this form for those who may benefit from them now.

Some of these items are programs that are ready to install,
as is. Other items represent major structural changes to existing
programs. 


bison2su - convert BISON-2 data formats to SU
#segdread - read an SEG-D tape
sucoher - a refraction seismic utility
#sugraybar - make a gray scale for PostScript graphics (1)
#suopsh - optimized shaping filter (2)
#wigupdates - suggestions for improving resolution of wiggle trace plots
#xlegend - add a legend to X windows graphics 
#xpicker - modified version of xwigb to permit interactive picking
#Cray - Ted Clee's cray contributions.
seg2segy - Brett Bennett's programs for converting SEG-2 data to SEG-Y format
PV-wave - Martin Luethi's extensions for interfacing SU with the PV-Wave
          commercial seismic package.
PromaxSU - John Anderson's extensions for interfacing with Promax
segytoseres - conversion program for taking data from segy to the SERES format
#XDR - Stew Levin's portable data format extensions.

Items with a '#' have been encorporated into the main body of the
CWP/SU package, or have otherwise been made obsolete.

(1) sugraybar has been made obsolete by Torsten Schoenfelder's legend
    option in psimage.
(2) suopsh has been replaced by  "sushape".

Dear John:

  This is my first shot at programming in SU. It may be a bit specialised for
general use, though. We have seismic refraction data that has been organised
as receiver site gathers, each trace of a gather representing the signal at
one location for a different shot, and each trace header carries the offset of
the shot from the receiver location. We can then treat the component traces of
a receiver gather spatially, arbitrarily picking one trace of the gather as
the "centre" trace and using the difference in shot point offsets between a
component trace and the "centre" trace as a trace-to-trace offset. Then for
each sample of "centre" trace various slowness lines are drawn across the
gather and that line with the largest magnitude sum replaces the sample on
the output trace (one output trace per input gather).

Regards,
Tony Kocurko
